With some sense of accomplishment,
I am delighted to present this dissertation, which is the culmination of over five years of dedication to expanding our understanding of biology.
This journey would not have been possible without the support, guidance, and encouragement of many.
I wish I could thank everyone involved personally, but my memory is not what it used to be when I first embarked on this quest...
As I reflect on this long process, 
I would like to offer my gratitude to those who have been instrumental in shaping my academic growth and in keeping my mental sanity.

I am so fortunate to have found not one, but two incredibly kind, patient and generous advisors.
Andy, thank you for your enthusiasm for science, for supporting my growth as a scientist, and for your encouragement through ups and downs.
Peter, thank your for your generosity and patience, for providing valuable and thorough insights, and for being a pillar of support throughout my academic journey.
I also need to thank both of you for nurturing sense of community and collegiality within our CoLab.

Next, I would like to thank my lab mates, collaborators and colleagues who have provided academic and emotional support throughout my journey.
Thank you to my amazingly helpful, supportive and fun lab mates: Jeff Adrion, CJ Battey, Jared Galloway, Matt Lukac, Anastasia Teterina, Gabby Coffing, Victoria Caudill, Saurabh Belsare, Vince Buffalo, Gilia Patterson, Chris Smith, Clara Rehmann, Jordan Anderson, Nate Pope, Jiseon Min, Jordan Rodriguez, Georgia Tsambos, Silas Tittes, Scott Small and Bruce Edelman.
Nate Pope, in particular, has been extremely patient and kind in collaborating with me to develop tsNN, herein presented as my fourth chapter.
I would like to thank my committee members, Matt Streisfeld, Kelley Harris, Jayson Paulose, and Patrick Phillips for all their support throughout these years.
My cohort mates have been so wonderful through the years and helped me make it through: Sabrina Mostoufi, Sophia Frantz, Monika Ruwaimana, Lina Aoyama, Max Spencer, Matt Lukac and Kayla Evans.
My friends and former roommates Zac Bush, Matt Lukac and Ethan Shaw made my graduate school experience so much more fun and enjoyable.
I am thankful to many other members of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution, including the behind the scenes staff that helped me with so many travel and purchase needs over these years;
thank you Arlene Crain, Sara Nash, Maria Heider, and Leah Frazier.
Thanks are also in order to my always supportive collaborators and members of the tskit ecosystem and the PopSim consortium.

Before my PhD, I was fortunate to encounter amazing individuals who played a pivotal role in shaping me as a scientist and biologist.
I would like to thank my undergraduate thesis advisor, Fernando Marques, for helping me get my feet wet with academic research.
Rodrigo Cogni, my master's advisor, who helped me make the jump into empirical population genetics.
John Pool welcomed me into his lab and gave me incredible freedom to do whatever research I wanted.
Paulo Inácio Prado, Alexandre Adalardo de Oliveira and Adriana Martini opened my eyes to the importance of theory, models and simulation in biology.
The entire team behind the Atlantic Forest Field Ecology course (offered by the Institute of Biosciences at the Universidade de São Paulo) contributed significantly to my growth as a naturalist.

I want to wholeheartedly thank my family and close friends,
whose unwavering encouragement and love have sustained me during the demanding years of my academic pursuit.
I have grown so much alongside my long-time friends: Bunni, Carol, Isa, Gabriel and Nat.
Looking forward to many more years of adventures and laughter together.
My Brazilians in Eugene crew -- Bia, Ciro, Giovani, Helena, Jack, Karl, Lívia, Suenia -- have made my life in Eugene much more colorful.
I would like to thank my siblings, Giovanna and João, for being a source of laughter, support and love.
Thank you to my mom, Kelly, for always supporting me with anything I set my mind to.
Her strength and determination are inspiring, and I would not have made it through without it.
Thank you to my dad, Aguinaldo, for showing me the great things one can accomplish with hard work and grit.
I am proud for what my parents accomplished in raising me and my siblings
at such a young age with little family support and no college education.
I also need to acknowledge my parents for partially supporting me financially throughout my entire academic career,
as this journey would have been orders of magnitude harder without it.


Lastly, I would like to thank my partner, Luiza, and my most loved pets, Ollie and Milo.
Luiza, thank you for providing steadfast support and understanding for the past (almost) ten years.
Your love, caring, patience, and belief in me have been a great source of strength.
Snuggling with you and our cats brings so much joy and comfort into my life.
I could not have done any of this without you anchoring and championing me!
