\chapter{Introduction}

\section{A more approachable introduction}
Evolution can occur over incredibly large spatial scales over the course of thousands to millions of years.
This makes Evolutionary biology unlike other fields within Biology in that hypotheses can not always be subject to experimentation.
Thus, we are left with the task of putting together what happened in the past based on information we have today.
To do so we need a sizable amount of data, models and statistical and computational tools.

One way to make inference about past evolutionary processes is by studying genetic variation within and between species.
Evolutionary processes, such as demographic processes, natural selection and mutation, impact the genetic variation in many ways.
For example, we expect the amount of variation within a species to be proportional to the mutation rate (\ie the higher the mutation rate, the more variation a population will harbor).
On the other hand, finite populations lose variation every generation due to genetic drift (\ie sampling error), 
and the magnitude of this loss is proportional to the population size.

We can write models in form of math equations that describe how some of these evolutionary processes impact genetic variation.
For example, $\pi$ (a metric of genetic variation) depends on the size of the population ($N$) and the mutation rate ($\mu$), such that $\pi \sim 4N\mu$.
If we knew the mutation rate, we could rearrange the equation to estimate the size of a population $N = \frac{\pi}{4\mu}$ from genetic data!
To arrive at this simple equation, we make the assumption that an individual is equally likely to mate with any other individual in the population (\ie panmixia).
It is easy to see how this may not always hold:
for example, a tree is much more likely to mate with another that lives close to it.

Adding biological realism to our math equation would prove to be complicated.
Alternatively, we can more easily simulate this process with a computer:
we can create virtual individuals and tell a computer how they choose their mates, pass on genetic material to their offspring, and change over time.
If we were to run virtual experiments like this many times,
it would be possible to map the relationship between genetic variation ($\pi$) and our parameters of interest (population size $N$ and mutation rate $\mu$).
This new map would be closer to the reality than our simplified mathematical model above,
but this approach is not a panacea, as simulations have a high computational cost (\ie they can take a long time to run).

In my dissertation, I have explored how we can incorporate computer simulations to help us understand evolution.
To this end, we need computational tools that are fast and reproducible (so that other researchers can use them).
So, in my second chapter, I discuss my contributions to tools that make these simulations run faster and to make them more reproducible.
Next, I gave my best to answer a long standing biological question: to what extent have humans and other apes been shaped by natural selection?
In my third chapter, I use simulations to tackle this question and show that both positive and negative selection are necessary to explain the genetic data obtained from multiple individuals for all great ape species.
Lastly, I wanted to build a proper statistical method that uses simulations to infer evolutionary processes from genetic data.
In my fourth chapter, I present a new method for evolutionary inference that uses genealogical trees along chromosomes (instead of tables with samples and mutations).
These trees capture the genetic data perfectly,
but they are much more scalable (use less space) and
they organize the data in a way that could be more conducive to extracting evolutionary information.

\section{A more specialized introduction}

% What are the major questions in evolutionary genetics?
Many questions in evolutionary biology are of a historical nature,
because evolution is restrict in space and time and it cannot be replicated.
An avenue for investigating past evolutionary events and processes lies in genetic data.
Evolutionary processes leave footprints on the genetic composition of populations,
so it might be possible to invert this relationship and use genetic data to infer the past.
Indeed, much of the field of evolutionary genetics is tasked with trying to infer past evolutionary events and processes from genetic data.
Some of the major questions the field has been interested in are:
Is it possible to find regions of the genome that were affected by natural selection?
Can we infer the movement of individuals and changes in population sizes over time?
What are the relative contributions of different evolutionary processes, such as demography and selection, in shaping patterns of genetic variation? 


% Data is not a limitation anymore
It has become clear that these questions I posed earlier cannot be investigated independently.
That is, to find regions of the genome under selection you need to understand the demographic history of populations,
and to infer demography from genetic data it is necessary to understand the effects of selections on genomes.


% What challenges are in the way of answering these questions?
Genetic data collection has increased exponentially over the past two decades.
Now, it is possible to sequence whole genomes for thousands of samples across multiple populations with relative ease.

% Computational and simulation advancements

% This makes simulation-based inference attractive to solve big problems in evo gen. What is simulation-based inference and how can it be applied to evogen?

% To make simulation-based inference possible, we need to maintain and develop scalable, tested and documented tools in pop gen (Chapter 1)

% In chapter 2, we present a large scale simulation study investigating the role of positive and negative selection in shaping genetic variation.

% In chapter 3, we develop a supervised machine learning method to infer evol params from data, exploring new facet of genetic variation.
