	abstract = {One important goal of population genetics is to understand the relative importance of different evolutionary processes for shaping variation in natural populations. Here, I use multilocus data to show that natural selection on both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations plays an important role in shaping levels of synonymous polymorphism in European aspen (Populus tremula). Previous studies have documented a preferential fixation of synonymous mutations encoding preferred codons in P. tremula. The results presented here show that this has resulted in an increase in codon bias in P. tremula, consistent with stronger selection acting on synonymous codon usage. In addition, positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations appears to be common in P. tremula, with approximately 30\% of all mutations having been fixed by positive selection. In addition, the recurrent fixation of beneficial mutations also reduces standing levels of polymorphism as evidenced by a significantly negative relationship between the rate of protein evolution synonymous site diversity and silent site diversity. Finally, I use approximate Bayesian methods to estimate the strength of selection acting on beneficial substitutions. These calculations show that recurrent hitchhiking reduces polymorphism by, on average, 30\%. The product of strength of selection acting on beneficial mutations and the rate by which these occur across the genome (2N(e)lambdas) equals 1.54x10( - 7), which is in line with estimates from Drosophila where recurrent hitchhiking has also been shown to have significant effects on standing levels of polymorphism.},

If the observed substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed differences between species should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. {DNA} sequence data on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, {EC} 1.1.1.1) in three species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.},

Moreover, many plants do not exhibit classic signatures of linked selection, such as a correlation between recombination rate and neutral diversity.

	abstract = {Much effort and interest have focused on assessing the importance of natural selection, particularly positive natural selection, in shaping the human genome. Although scans for positive selection have identified candidate loci that may be associated with positive selection in humans, such scans do not indicate whether adaptation is frequent in general in humans. Studies based on the reasoning of the {MacDonald}–Kreitman test, which, in principle, can be used to evaluate the extent of positive selection, suggested that adaptation is detectable in the human genome but that it is less common than in Drosophila or Escherichia coli. Both positive and purifying natural selection at functional sites should affect levels and patterns of polymorphism at linked nonfunctional sites. Here, we search for these effects by analyzing patterns of neutral polymorphism in humans in relation to the rates of recombination, functional density, and functional divergence with chimpanzees. We find that the levels of neutral polymorphism are lower in the regions of lower recombination and in the regions of higher functional density or divergence. These correlations persist after controlling for the variation in {GC} content, density of simple repeats, selective constraint, mutation rate, and depth of sequencing coverage. We argue that these results are most plausibly explained by the effects of natural selection at functional sites—either recurrent selective sweeps or background selection—on the levels of linked neutral polymorphism. Natural selection at both coding and regulatory sites appears to affect linked neutral polymorphism, reducing neutral polymorphism by 6\% genome-wide and by 11\% in the gene-rich half of the human genome. These findings suggest that the effects of natural selection at linked sites cannot be ignored in the study of neutral human polymorphism.},

	abstract = {A major question in evolutionary biology is how natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation across the human genome. Previous work has documented a reduction in genetic diversity in regions of the genome with low recombination rates. However, it is unclear whether other summaries of genetic variation, like allele frequencies, are also correlated with recombination rate and whether these correlations can be explained solely by negative selection against deleterious mutations or whether positive selection acting on favorable alleles is also required. Here we attempt to address these questions by analyzing three different genome-wide resequencing datasets from European individuals. We document several significant correlations between different genomic features. In particular, we find that average minor allele frequency and diversity are reduced in regions of low recombination and that human diversity, human-chimp divergence, and average minor allele frequency are reduced near genes. Population genetic simulations show that either positive natural selection acting on favorable mutations or negative natural selection acting against deleterious mutations can explain these correlations. However, models with strong positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations and little negative selection predict a stronger negative correlation between neutral diversity and nonsynonymous divergence than observed in the actual data, supporting the importance of negative, rather than positive, selection throughout the genome. Further, we show that the widespread presence of weakly deleterious alleles, rather than a small number of strongly positively selected mutations, is responsible for the correlation between neutral genetic diversity and recombination rate. This work suggests that natural selection has affected multiple aspects of linked neutral variation throughout the human genome and that positive selection is not required to explain these observations.},

	abstract = {Natural populations often grow, shrink, and migrate over time. Such demographic processes can affect genome-wide levels of genetic diversity. Additionally, genetic variation in functional regions of the genome can be altered by natural selection, which drives adaptive mutations to higher frequencies or purges deleterious ones. Such selective processes affect not only the sites directly under selection but also nearby neutral variation through genetic linkage via processes referred to as genetic hitchhiking in the context of positive selection and background selection ({BGS}) in the context of purifying selection. While there is extensive literature examining the consequences of selection at linked sites at demographic equilibrium, less is known about how non-equilibrium demographic processes influence the effects of hitchhiking and {BGS}. Utilizing a global sample of human whole-genome sequences from the Thousand Genomes Project and extensive simulations, we investigate how non-equilibrium demographic processes magnify and dampen the consequences of selection at linked sites across the human genome. When binning the genome by inferred strength of {BGS}, we observe that, compared to Africans, non-African populations have experienced larger proportional decreases in neutral genetic diversity in strong {BGS} regions. We replicate these findings in admixed populations by showing that non-African ancestral components of the genome have also been affected more severely in these regions. We attribute these differences to the strong, sustained/recurrent population bottlenecks that non-Africans experienced as they migrated out of Africa and throughout the globe. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between {FST} and the inferred strength of {BGS}, suggesting a stronger rate of genetic drift. Forward simulations of human demographic history with a model of {BGS} support these observations. Our results show that non-equilibrium demography significantly alters the consequences of selection at linked sites and support the need for more work investigating the dynamic process of multiple evolutionary forces operating in concert.},

However, little is known about associated selection coefficients of beneficial amino acid mutations. Recurrent selective sweeps associated with adaptive substitutions should leave a characteristic signature in genome variability data that contains information about the frequency and strength of selection. Here, I document a significant negative correlation between the level and the frequency of synonymous site polymorphism and the rate of protein evolution in highly recombining regions of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. This pattern is predicted by recurrent adaptive protein evolution and suggests that adaptation is an important determinant of patterns of neutral variation genome-wide. Using a maximum likelihood approach, I estimate the product of the rate and strength of selection under a recurrent genetic hitchhiking model, λ̅2Nes ∼ 3 × 10−8. Using an approach based on the {McDonald}-Kreitman test, I estimate that ∼50\% of divergent amino acids were driven to fixation by positive selection, implying that beneficial amino acid substitutions are of weak effect on average, on the order of 10−5 (i.e., 2Nes ∼ 40). Two implications of these results are that most adaptive substitutions will be difficult to detect in genome scans of selection and that population size (and genetic drift) may be an important determinant of the evolutionary dynamics of protein adaptation.},

	abstract = {The effect of recurrent selective sweeps is a spatially heterogeneous reduction in neutral polymorphism throughout the genome. The pattern of reduction depends on the selective advantage and recurrence rate of the sweeps. Because many adaptive substitutions responsible for these sweeps also contribute to nonsynonymous divergence, the spatial distribution of nonsynonymous divergence also reflects the distribution of adaptive substitutions. Thus, the spatial correspondence between neutral polymorphism and nonsynonymous divergence may be especially informative about the process of adaptation. Here we study this correspondence using genomewide polymorphism data from Drosophila simulans and the divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Focusing on highly recombining portions of the autosomes, at a spatial scale appropriate to the study of selective sweeps, we find that neutral polymorphism is both lower and, as measured by a new statistic Q(S), less homogeneous where nonsynonymous divergence is higher and that the spatial structure of this correlation is best explained by the action of strong recurrent selective sweeps. We introduce a method to infer, from the spatial correspondence between polymorphism and divergence, the rate and selective strength of adaptation. Our results independently confirm a high rate of adaptive substitution (approximately 1/3000 generations) and newly suggest that many adaptations are of surprisingly great selective effect (approximately 1\%), reducing the effective population size by approximately 15\% even in highly recombining regions of the genome.},

Quantifying the effects of “linked selection” on levels of genetic diversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection and selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples using composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions ({UTR}). They allow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions ({UTRs}). Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger effect in reducing diversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than previously appreciated.},

	abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However, this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range. Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on body size and species range as proxies for census population size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc than those with small Nc and provides direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species. This implies that natural selection may provide an explanation for this longstanding paradox of population genetics.},

The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.},

	abstract = {Neutral genetic diversity across the genome is determined by the complex interplay of mutation, demographic history, and natural selection. While the direct action of natural selection is limited to functional loci across the genome, its impact can have effects on nearby neutral loci due to genetic linkage. These effects of selection at linked sites, referred to as genetic hitchhiking and background selection ({BGS}), are pervasive across natural populations. However, only recently has there been a focus on the joint consequences of demography and selection at linked sites, and some empirical studies have come to apparently contradictory conclusions as to their combined effects. To understand the relationship between demography and selection at linked sites, we conducted an extensive forward simulation study of {BGS} under a range of demographic models. We found that the relative levels of diversity in {BGS} and neutral regions vary over time and that the initial dynamics after a population size change are often in the opposite direction of the long-term expected trajectory. Our detailed observations of the temporal dynamics of neutral diversity in the context of selection at linked sites in nonequilibrium populations provide new intuition about why patterns of diversity under {BGS} vary through time in natural populations and help reconcile previously contradictory observations. Most notably, our results highlight that classical models of {BGS} are poorly suited for predicting diversity in nonequilibrium populations.},

Here, we use whole-genome resequencing data from four Populus species spanning the speciation continuum to reconstruct their demographic histories and investigate patterns of diversity and divergence within and between species. Using Populus trichocarpa as an outgroup species, we further infer the genealogical relationships and estimate the extent of ancient introgression among the three aspen species (Populus tremula, Populus davidiana and Populus tremuloides) throughout the genome. Our results show substantial variation in these patterns along the genomes with this variation being strongly predicted by local recombination rates and the density of functional elements. This implies that the interaction between recurrent selection and intrinsic genomic features has dramatically sculpted the genomic landscape over long periods of time. In addition, our findings provide evidence that, apart from background selection, recent positive selection and long-term balancing selection have also been crucial components in shaping patterns of genome-wide variation during the speciation process.},

	abstract = {The rate at which genomes adapt to environmental changes and the prevalence of adaptive processes in molecular evolution are two controversial issues in current evolutionary genetics. Previous attempts to quantify the genome-wide rate of adaptation through amino-acid substitution have revealed a surprising diversity of patterns, with some species (e.g. Drosophila) experiencing a very high adaptive rate, while other (e.g. humans) are dominated by nearly-neutral processes. It has been suggested that this discrepancy reflects between-species differences in effective population size. Published studies, however, were mainly focused on model organisms, and relied on disparate data sets and methodologies, so that an overview of the prevalence of adaptive protein evolution in nature is currently lacking. Here we extend existing estimators of the amino-acid adaptive rate by explicitly modelling the effect of favourable mutations on non-synonymous polymorphism patterns, and we apply these methods to a newly-built, homogeneous data set of 44 non-model animal species pairs. Data analysis uncovers a major contribution of adaptive evolution to the amino-acid substitution process across all major metazoan phyla—with the notable exception of humans and primates. The proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitution is found to be positively correlated to species effective population size. This relationship, however, appears to be primarily driven by a decreased rate of nearly-neutral amino-acid substitution because of more efficient purifying selection in large populations. Our results reveal that adaptive processes dominate the evolution of proteins in most animal species, but do not corroborate the hypothesis that adaptive substitutions accumulate at a faster rate in large populations. Implications regarding the factors influencing the rate of adaptive evolution and positive selection detection in humans vs. other organisms are discussed.},

	abstract = {A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand how natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation across genomes. Studies in a variety of species have shown that neutral genetic diversity (intra-species differences) has been reduced at sites linked to those under direct selection. However, the effect of linked selection on neutral sequence divergence (inter-species differences) remains ambiguous. While empirical studies have reported correlations between divergence and recombination, which is interpreted as evidence for natural selection reducing linked neutral divergence, theory argues otherwise, especially for species that have diverged long ago. Here we address these outstanding issues by examining whether natural selection can affect divergence between both closely and distantly related species. We show that neutral divergence between closely related species (e.g. human-primate) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. We also find that neutral divergence between distantly related species (e.g. human-rodent) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for the confounding factors of hypermutable {CpG} sites, {GC} content, and biased gene conversion. Coalescent models indicate that even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, background selection in the ancestral population can still explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome, generating the observed correlations. Our findings reveal that, contrary to previous intuition, natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species. Though we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the direct effects of purifying selection drive some of these patterns, such a scenario would be possible only if more of the genome is under purifying selection than currently believed. Our work has implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.},

Here, I analyze geographic population structure and genome-wide patterns of variation in the Rufous, Allen's, and Calliope Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus/Selasphorus sasin/Selasphorus calliope) and assess evidence that linked selection on the Z chromosome drives patterns of genetic differentiation in a pair of hybridizing species. Demographic models, introgression tests, and genotype clustering analyses support a reticulate evolutionary history consistent with divergence during the late Pleistocene followed by gene flow across migrant Rufous and Allen's Hummingbirds during the Holocene. Relative genetic differentiation () is elevated, and within-population diversity (π) is depressed on the Z chromosome in all interspecific comparisons. The ratio of Z to autosomal within-population diversity is much lower than that expected from population size effects alone, and Tajima's D is depressed on the Z chromosome in S. rufus and S. calliope. These results suggest that conserved structural features of the genome play a prominent role in shaping genetic differentiation through the early stages of speciation in northern Selasphorus hummingbirds, and that the Z chromosome is a likely site of genes underlying behavioral and morphological variation in the group.},

A point of “best fit” was found between background-selection predictions and estimates of human effective population sizes, with reasonable parameter estimates whose uncertainty was assessed by bootstrapping. The results suggest that the purging of deleterious alleles has had some influence on shaping levels of human variation, although the effects may be subtle over the majority of the human genome.

	abstract = {Speciation is a continuous process during which genetic changes gradually accumulate in the genomes of diverging species. Recent studies have documented highly heterogeneous differentiation landscapes, with distinct regions of elevated differentiation (“differentiation islands”) widespread across genomes. However, it remains unclear which processes drive the evolution of differentiation islands; how the differentiation landscape evolves as speciation advances; and ultimately, how differentiation islands are related to speciation. Here, we addressed these questions based on population genetic analyses of 200 resequenced genomes from 10 populations of four Ficedula flycatcher sister species. We show that a heterogeneous differentiation landscape starts emerging among populations within species, and differentiation islands evolve recurrently in the very same genomic regions among independent lineages. Contrary to expectations from models that interpret differentiation islands as genomic regions involved in reproductive isolation that are shielded from gene flow, patterns of sequence divergence (dxy and relative node depth) do not support a major role of gene flow in the evolution of the differentiation landscape in these species. Instead, as predicted by models of linked selection, genome-wide variation in diversity and differentiation can be explained by variation in recombination rate and the density of targets for selection. We thus conclude that the heterogeneous landscape of differentiation in Ficedula flycatchers evolves mainly as the result of background selection and selective sweeps in genomic regions of low recombination. Our results emphasize the necessity of incorporating linked selection as a null model to identify genome regions involved in adaptation and speciation.},

Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.},

	abstract = {{GC}-biased gene conversion ({gBGC}) is a recombination-associated evolutionary process that accelerates the fixation of guanine or cytosine alleles, regardless of their effects on fitness. {gBGC} can increase the overall rate of substitutions, a hallmark of positive selection. Many fast-evolving genes and noncoding sequences in the human genome have {GC}-biased substitution patterns, suggesting that {gBGC}-in contrast to adaptive processes-may have driven the human changes in these sequences. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a substitution model for {DNA} sequence evolution that quantifies the nonlinear interacting effects of selection and {gBGC} on substitution rates and patterns. Based on this model, we used a series of lineage-specific likelihood ratio tests to evaluate sequence alignments for evidence of changes in mode of selection, action of {gBGC}, or both. With a false positive rate of less than 5\% for individual tests, we found that the majority (76\%) of previously identified human accelerated regions are best explained without {gBGC}, whereas a substantial minority (19\%) are best explained by the action of {gBGC} alone. Further, more than half (55\%) have substitution rates that significantly exceed local estimates of the neutral rate, suggesting that these regions may have been shaped by positive selection rather than by relaxation of constraint. By distinguishing the effects of {gBGC}, relaxation of constraint, and positive selection we provide an integrated analysis of the evolutionary forces that shaped the fastest evolving regions of the human genome, which facilitates the design of targeted functional studies of adaptation in humans.},

	abstract = {Unraveling the evolutionary forces responsible for variations of neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of {GC}-content (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We show that the {GC}-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47\%). This demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of {GC}-content. The evolution of {GC}-content correlates much more strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the neutral process of biased gene conversion ({BGC}) occurring within recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in the human genome. This model notably explains the positive correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate. Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore, recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots. This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions. We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and drift, {BGC} is one of the major factors driving genome evolution. Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density between human and chimp., Mammalian genomes show a very strong heterogeneity of base composition along chromosomes (the so-called isochores). The functional significance of these peculiar genomic landscapes is highly debated: do isochores confer some selective advantage, or are they simply the by-product of neutral evolutionary processes? To resolve this issue, we analyzed the pattern of substitution in the human genome by comparison with chimpanzee and macaque. We show that the evolution of base composition ({GC}-content) is essentially determined by the rate of recombination. This effect appears to be much stronger in male than in female germline, which rules out selective explanations for the evolution of isochores. We show that this impact of recombination is most probably a consequence of the process of biased gene conversion ({BGC}). This neutral process mimics the action of selection and can induce strong substitution hotspots within recombination hotspots, sometimes leading to the fixation of deleterious mutations. {BGC} appears to be one of the major factors driving genome evolution. It is therefore essential to take this process into account if we want to be able to interpret genome sequences.},

	abstract = {Much evidence indicates that {GC}-biased gene conversion ({gBGC}) has a major impact on the evolution of mammalian genomes. However, a detailed quantification of the process is still lacking. The strength of {gBGC} can be measured from the analysis of derived allele frequency spectra ({DAF}), but this approach is sensitive to a number of confounding factors. In particular, we show by simulations that the inference is pervasively affected by polymorphism polarization errors and by spatial heterogeneity in {gBGC} strength. We propose a new general method to quantify {gBGC} from {DAF} spectra, incorporating polarization errors, taking spatial heterogeneity into account, and jointly estimating mutation bias. Applying it to human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that the strength of {gBGC} does not differ between hypermutable {CpG} sites and non-{CpG} sites, suggesting that in humans {gBGC} is not caused by the base-excision repair machinery. Genome-wide, the intensity of {gBGC} is in the nearly neutral area. However, given that recombination occurs primarily within recombination hotspots, 1\%–2\% of the human genome is subject to strong {gBGC}. On average, {gBGC} is stronger in African than in non-African populations, reflecting differences in effective population sizes. However, due to more heterogeneous recombination landscapes, the fraction of the genome affected by strong {gBGC} is larger in non-African than in African populations. Given that the location of recombination hotspots evolves very rapidly, our analysis predicts that, in the long term, a large fraction of the genome is affected by short episodes of strong {gBGC}.},

	abstract = {Genomewide screens of genetic variation within and between populations can reveal signatures of selection implicated in adaptation and speciation. Genomic regions with low genetic diversity and elevated differentiation reflective of locally reduced effective population sizes (Ne) are candidates for barrier loci contributing to population divergence. Yet, such candidate genomic regions need not arise as a result of selection promoting adaptation or advancing reproductive isolation. Linked selection unrelated to lineage-specific adaptation or population divergence can generate comparable signatures. It is challenging to distinguish between these processes, particularly when diverging populations share ancestral genetic variation. In this study, we took a comparative approach using population assemblages from distant clades assessing genomic parallelism of variation in Ne. Utilizing population-level polymorphism data from 444 resequenced genomes of three avian clades spanning 50 million years of evolution, we tested whether population genetic summary statistics reflecting genomewide variation in Ne would covary among populations within clades, and importantly, also among clades where lineage sorting has been completed. All statistics including population-scaled recombination rate (ρ), nucleotide diversity (π) and measures of genetic differentiation between populations ({FST}, {PBS}, dxy) were significantly correlated across all phylogenetic distances. Moreover, genomic regions with elevated levels of genetic differentiation were associated with inferred pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. The phylogenetic stability of diversity landscapes and stable association with genomic features support a role of linked selection not necessarily associated with adaptation and speciation in shaping patterns of genomewide heterogeneity in genetic diversity.},

This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is known as Lewontin’s Paradox of Variation (1974). While some have suggested selection constrains diversity, tests of this hypothesis seem to fall short. Here, I revisit Lewontin’s Paradox to assess whether current models of linked selection are capable of reducing diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine previously-published estimates of pairwise diversity from 172 metazoan taxa with newly derived estimates of census sizes. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, I show this relationship is significant accounting for phylogeny, but with high phylogenetic signal and evidence that some lineages experience shifts in the evolutionary rate of diversity deep in the past. Additionally, I find a negative relationship between recombination map length and census size, suggesting abundant species have less recombination and experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. However, I show that even assuming strong and abundant selection, models of linked selection are unlikely to explain the observed relationship between diversity and census sizes across species.},

Pertinent to the question of the relative importance of these two forces is the observation that both diversity within species and interspecies divergence increase with recombination rates. This suggests that mutation and recombination are either directly coupled or linked through some third factor. Here, we test these possibilities using the recently generated sequence of the chimpanzee genome and new estimates of human diversity. We find that measures of {GC} and {CpG} content, simple-repeat structures, as well as the distance from the centromeres and the telomeres predict diversity as well as divergence. After controlling for these factors, large-scale recombination rates measured from pedigrees are still significant predictors of human diversity and human-chimpanzee divergence. Furthermore, the correlation between human diversity and recombination remains significant even after controlling for human-chimpanzee divergence. Two plausible and non-mutually exclusive explanations are, first, that natural selection has shaped the patterns of diversity seen in humans and, second, that recombination rates across the genome have changed since humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor, so that current recombination rates are a better predictor of diversity than of divergence. Because there are indications that recombination rates may have changed rapidly during human evolution, we favor the latter explanation.},

Importantly, synonymous sites and non-transcribed regions are also affected, albeit to different degrees. Their use for demographic inference can lead to strong biases.

Here we address the question using a comparative approach to contrast diversity patterns according to the distance from genes in all great ape taxa. The extent of diversity reduction near genes compared with the rest of intergenic sequences is greater in a species with larger effective population size. Also, the maximum distance from genes at which the diversity reduction is observed is larger in species with large effective population size. In Sumatran orangutans, the overall genomic diversity is ∼30\% smaller than diversity levels far from genes, whereas this reduction is only 9\% in humans. We show by simulation that selection against deleterious mutations in the form of background selection is not expected to cause these differences in diversity among species. Instead, selective sweeps caused by positive selection can reduce diversity level more severely in a large population if there is a higher number of selective sweeps per unit time. We discuss what can cause such a correlation, including the possibility that more frequent sweeps in larger populations are due to a shorter waiting time for the right mutations to arise.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly 'simplify' a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulation's entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.},

Such models can generally be implemented as individual-based forward simulations, but the large computational overhead of these models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in large populations infeasible. This situation presents an important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently developed tree-sequence recording method (Kelleher, Thornton, Ashander, \& Ralph, 2018), which stores the genealogical history of all genomes in the simulated population, could provide such an advance. This method has several benefits: (1) it allows neutral mutations to be omitted entirely from forward-time simulations and added later, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency; (2) it allows neutral burn-in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact, using “recapitation”; (3) it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact representation of a population's genealogy that can be analysed in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the tree-sequence recording method in {SLiM} 3 (a free, open-source evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to allow the recording of non-neutral mutations, greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase several practical applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modelling and exploration of evolutionary processes.},

We use the unfolded site frequency spectrum of polymorphic mutations (n = 8 haploid chromosomes per population) to estimate the {DFE}. We find that the shape of the deleterious {DFE} is strikingly similar across great apes. We confirm that effective population size (Ne) is a strong predictor of the strength of negative selection, consistent with the nearly neutral theory. However, we also find that the strength of negative selection varies more than expected given the differences in Ne between species. Across species, mean fitness effects of new deleterious mutations covaries with Ne, consistent with positive epistasis among deleterious mutations. We find that the strength of negative selection for the smallest populations, bonobos and western chimpanzees, is higher than expected given their Ne. This may result from a more efficient purging of strongly deleterious recessive variants in these populations. Forward simulations confirm that these findings are not artifacts of the way we are inferring Ne and {DFE} parameters.

	abstract = {Speciation genomic studies aim to interpret patterns of genome-wide variation in light of the processes that give rise to new species. However, interpreting the genomic “landscape” of speciation is difficult, because many evolutionary processes can impact levels of variation. Facilitated by the first chromosome-level assembly for the group, we use whole-genome sequencing and simulations to shed light on the processes that have shaped the genomic landscape during a radiation of monkeyflowers. After inferring the phylogenetic relationships among the 9 taxa in this radiation, we show that highly similar diversity (π) and differentiation ({FST}) landscapes have emerged across the group. Variation in these landscapes was strongly predicted by the local density of functional elements and the recombination rate, suggesting that the landscapes have been shaped by widespread natural selection. Using the varying divergence times between pairs of taxa, we show that the correlations between {FST} and genome features arose almost immediately after a population split and have become stronger over time. Simulations of genomic landscape evolution suggest that background selection ({BGS}; i.e., selection against deleterious mutations) alone is too subtle to generate the observed patterns, but scenarios that involve positive selection and genetic incompatibilities are plausible alternative explanations. Finally, tests for introgression among these taxa reveal widespread evidence of heterogeneous selection against gene flow during this radiation. Combined with previous evidence for adaptation in this system, we conclude that the correlation in {FST} among these taxa informs us about the processes contributing to adaptation and speciation during a rapid radiation.},

	abstract = {Recombination is typically thought of as a symmetrical process resulting in large-scale reciprocal genetic exchanges between homologous chromosomes. Recombination events, however, are also accompanied by short-scale, unidirectional exchanges known as gene conversion in the neighborhood of the initiating double-strand break. A large body of evidence suggests that gene conversion is {GC}-biased in many eukaryotes, including mammals and human. {AT}/{GC} heterozygotes produce more {GC}- than {AT}-gametes, thus conferring a population advantage to {GC}-alleles in high-recombining regions. This apparently unimportant feature of our molecular machinery has major evolutionary consequences. Structurally, {GC}-biased gene conversion explains the spatial distribution of {GC}-content in mammalian genomes-the so-called isochore structure. Functionally, {GC}-biased gene conversion promotes the segregation and fixation of deleterious {AT} –{\textbackslash}textgreater {GC} mutations, thus increasing our genomic mutation load. Here we review the recent evidence for a {GC}-biased gene conversion process in mammals, and its consequences for genomic landscapes, molecular evolution, and human functional genomics.},

We solve these problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact simulation of the coalescent with recombination for chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate methods.

	abstract = {A spotlight on great ape genomes Most nonhuman primate genomes generated to date have been “humanized” owing to their many gaps and the reliance on guidance by the reference human genome. To remove this humanizing effect, Kronenberg et al. generated and assembled long-read genomes of a chimpanzee, an orangutan, and two humans and compared them with a previously generated gorilla genome. This analysis recognized genomic structural variation specific to humans and particular ape lineages. Comparisons between human and chimpanzee cerebral organoids showed down-regulation of the expression of specific genes in humans, relative to chimpanzees, related to noncoding variation identified in this analysis. Science, this issue p. eaar6343 Structured Abstract {INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding} the genetic differences that make us human is a long-standing endeavor that requires the comprehensive discovery and comparison of all forms of genetic variation within great ape lineages. {RATIONALEThe} varied quality and completeness of ape genomes have limited comparative genetic analyses. To eliminate this contiguity and quality disparity, we generated human and nonhuman ape genome assemblies without the guidance of the human reference genome. These new genome assemblies enable both coarse and fine-scale comparative genomic studies. {RESULTSWe} sequenced and assembled two human, one chimpanzee, and one orangutan genome using high-coverage ({\textbackslash}textgreater65x) single-molecule, real-time ({SMRT}) long-read sequencing technology. We also sequenced more than 500,000 full-length complementary {DNA} samples from induced pluripotent stem cells to construct de novo gene models, increasing our knowledge of transcript diversity in each ape lineage. The new nonhuman ape genome assemblies improve gene annotation and genomic contiguity (by 30- to 500-fold), resulting in the identification of larger synteny blocks (by 22- to 74-fold) when compared to earlier assemblies. Including the latest gorilla genome, we now estimate that 83\% of the ape genomes can be compared in a multiple sequence alignment.We observe a modest increase in single-nucleotide variant divergence compared to previous genome analyses and estimate that 36\% of human autosomal {DNA} is subject to incomplete lineage sorting. We fully resolve most common repeat differences, including full-length retrotransposons such as the African ape-specific endogenous retroviral element {PtERV}1. We show that the spread of this element independently in the gorilla and chimpanzee lineage likely resulted from a founder element that failed to segregate to the human lineage because of incomplete lineage sorting.The improved sequence contiguity allowed a more systematic discovery of structural variation ({\textbackslash}textgreater50 base pairs in length) (see the figure). We detected 614,186 ape deletions, insertions, and inversions, assigning each to specific ape lineages. Unbiased genome scaffolding (optical maps, bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization) led to the discovery of large, unknown complex inversions in gene-rich regions. Of the 17,789 fixed human-specific insertions and deletions, we focus on those of potential functional effect. We identify 90 that are predicted to disrupt genes and an additional 643 that likely affect regulatory regions, more than doubling the number of human-specific deletions that remove regulatory sequence in the human lineage. We investigate the association of structural variation with changes in human-chimpanzee brain gene expression using cerebral organoids as a proxy for expression differences. Genes associated with fixed structural variants ({SVs}) show a pattern of down-regulation in human radial glial neural progenitors, whereas human-specific duplications are associated with up-regulated genes in human radial glial and excitatory neurons (see the figure). {CONCLUSIONThe} improved ape genome assemblies provide the most comprehensive view to date of intermediate-size structural variation and highlight several dozen genes associated with structural variation and brain-expression differences between humans and chimpanzees. These new references will provide a stepping stone for the completion of great ape genomes at a quality commensurate with the human reference genome and, ultimately, an understanding of the genetic differences that make us human. {\textbackslash}textlessimg class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/360/6393/eaar6343/F1.medium.gif"/{\textbackslash}textgreater Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint {SMRT} assemblies and {SV} analyses.(Top) Contiguity of the de novo assemblies.

Each heatmap row is a gene that intersects an insertion or deletion (green), duplication (cyan), or inversion (light green). Genetic studies of human evolution require high-quality contiguous ape genome assemblies that are not guided by the human reference. We coupled long-read sequence assembly and full-length complementary {DNA} sequencing with a multiplatform scaffolding approach to produce ab initio chimpanzee and orangutan genome assemblies. By comparing these with two long-read de novo human genome assemblies and a gorilla genome assembly, we characterized lineage-specific and shared great ape genetic variation ranging from single– to mega–base pair–sized variants. We identified {\textbackslash}textasciitilde17,000 fixed human-specific structural variants identifying genic and putative regulatory changes that have emerged in humans since divergence from nonhuman apes. Interestingly, these variants are enriched near genes that are down-regulated in human compared to chimpanzee cerebral organoids, particularly in cells analogous to radial glial neural progenitors.

The hybridization patterns unequivocally demonstrate the high degree of chromosomal homology and synteny of great ape and human chromosomes. Relative to human, no translocations were detected in great apes, except for the well-known fusion-origin of human chromosome 2 and a 5;17 translocation in the gorilla. In contrast, numerous translocations were detected that have led to the massive reorganization of the gibbon karyotype: the 22 autosomal human chromosomes have been divided into 51 elements to compose the 21 gibbon autosomes.

	abstract = {The African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (A. gambiae), provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of reproductive isolation because it is divided into two sympatric, partially isolated subtaxa known as M form and S form. With the annotated genome of this species now available, high-throughput techniques can be applied to locate and characterize the genomic regions contributing to reproductive isolation. In order to quantify patterns of differentiation within A. gambiae, we hybridized population samples of genomic {DNA} from each form to Affymetrix {GeneChip} microarrays. We found that three regions, together encompassing less than 2.8 Mb, are the only locations where the M and S forms are significantly differentiated. Two of these regions are adjacent to centromeres, on Chromosomes 2L and X, and contain 50 and 12 predicted genes, respectively. Sequenced loci in these regions contain fixed differences between forms and no shared polymorphisms, while no fixed differences were found at nearby control loci. The third region, on Chromosome 2R, contains only five predicted genes; fixed differences in this region were also verified by direct sequencing. These “speciation islands” remain differentiated despite considerable gene flow, and are therefore expected to contain the genes responsible for reproductive isolation. Much effort has recently been applied to locating the genes and genetic changes responsible for reproductive isolation between species. Though much can be inferred about speciation by studying taxa that have diverged for millions of years, studying differentiation between taxa that are in the early stages of isolation will lead to a clearer view of the number and size of regions involved in the genetics of speciation. Despite appreciable levels of gene flow between the M and S forms of A. gambiae, we were able to isolate three small regions of differentiation where genes responsible for ecological and behavioral isolation are likely to be located. We expect reproductive isolation to be due to changes at a small number of loci, as these regions together contain only 67 predicted genes. Concentrating future mapping experiments on these regions should reveal the genes responsible for reproductive isolation between forms., Using {DNA} microarrays, the authors identify 3 small regions of the genome that differ between two forms of hybridizing mosquitoes; regions that are likely to contain the genes responsible for reproductive isolation.},

	abstract = {The metaphor of ‘genomic islands of speciation’ was first used to describe heterogeneous differentiation among loci between the genomes of closely related species. The biological model proposed to explain these differences was that the regions showing high levels of differentiation were resistant to gene flow between species, while the remainder of the genome was being homogenized by gene flow and consequently showed lower levels of differentiation. However, the conditions under which such differentiation can occur at multiple unlinked loci are restrictive; additionally, essentially, all previous analyses have been carried out using relative measures of divergence, which can be misleading when regions with different levels of recombination are compared. Here, we test the model of differential gene flow by asking whether absolute divergence is also higher in the previously identified ‘islands’. Using five species pairs for which full sequence data are available, we find that absolute measures of divergence are not higher in genomic islands. Instead, in all cases examined, we find reduced diversity in these regions, a consequence of which is that relative measures of divergence are abnormally high. These data therefore do not support a model of differential gene flow among loci, although islands of relative divergence may represent loci involved in local adaptation. Simulations using the program {IMa}2 further suggest that inferences of any gene flow may be incorrect in many comparisons. We instead present an alternative explanation for heterogeneous patterns of differentiation, one in which postspeciation selection generates patterns consistent with multiple aspects of the data.},

	issn = {0016-6731},
	abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

This cannot be explained by variation in mutation rates and/or functional constraint, because we observe no correlation between recombination rates and {DNA} sequence divergence between D. melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans. We suggest that the correlation may result from genetic hitch-hiking associated with the fixation of advantageous mutants.

	abstract = {Recent technological developments allow investigation of the repeatability of evolution at the genomic level. Such investigation is particularly powerful when applied to a ring species, in which spatial variation represents changes during the evolution of two species from one. We examined genomic variation among three subspecies of the greenish warbler ring species, using genotypes at 13 013 950 nucleotide sites along a new greenish warbler consensus genome assembly. Genomic regions of low within-group variation are remarkably consistent between the three populations. These regions show high relative differentiation but low absolute differentiation between populations. Comparisons with outgroup species show the locations of these peaks of relative differentiation are not well explained by phylogenetically conserved variation in recombination rates or selection. These patterns are consistent with a model in which selection in an ancestral form has reduced variation at some parts of the genome, and those same regions experience recurrent selection that subsequently reduces variation within each subspecies. The degree of heterogeneity in nucleotide diversity is greater than explained by models of background selection, but is consistent with selective sweeps. Given the evidence that greenish warblers have had both population differentiation for a long period of time and periods of gene flow between those populations, we propose that some genomic regions underwent selective sweeps over a broad geographic area followed by within-population selection-induced reductions in variation. An important implication of this 'sweep-before-differentiation' model is that genomic regions of high relative differentiation may have moved among populations more recently than other genomic regions.},

Populus tremula and Populus tremuloides are two of the most widespread tree species in the Northern Hemisphere. Using whole-genome re-sequencing data of 24 P. tremula and 22 P. tremuloides individuals, we find that the two species diverged ∼2.2-3.1 million years ago, coinciding with the severing of the Bering land bridge and the onset of dramatic climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene. Both species have experienced substantial population expansions following long-term declines after species divergence. We detect widespread and heterogeneous genomic differentiation between species, and in accordance with the expectation of allopatric speciation, coalescent simulations suggest that neutral evolutionary processes can account for most of the observed patterns of genetic differentiation. However, there is an excess of regions exhibiting extreme differentiation relative to those expected under demographic simulations, which is indicative of the action of natural selection. Overall genetic differentiation is negatively associated with recombination rate in both species, providing strong support for a role of linked selection in generating the heterogeneous genomic landscape of differentiation between species. Finally, we identify a number of candidate regions and genes that may have been subject to positive and/or balancing selection during the speciation process.},

	abstract = {Comparative studies of closely related taxa can provide insights into the evolutionary forces that shape genome evolution and the prevalence of convergent molecular evolution. We investigated patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation in stonechats (genus Saxicola), a widely distributed avian species complex with phenotypic variation in plumage, morphology and migratory behaviour, to ask whether similar genomic regions have become differentiated in independent, but closely related, taxa. We used whole-genome pooled sequencing of 262 individuals from five taxa and found that levels of genetic diversity and divergence are strongly correlated among different stonechat taxa. We then asked whether these patterns remain correlated at deeper evolutionary scales and found that homologous genomic regions have become differentiated in stonechats and the closely related Ficedula flycatchers. Such correlation across a range of evolutionary divergence and among phylogenetically independent comparisons suggests that similar processes may be driving the differentiation of these independently evolving lineages, which in turn may be the result of intrinsic properties of particular genomic regions (e.g. areas of low recombination). Consequently, studies employing genome scans to search for areas important for reproductive isolation or adaptation should account for corresponding regions of differentiation, as these regions may not necessarily represent speciation islands or evidence of local adaptation.},

The {SLiM} forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce {SLiM} 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or "{nonWF}" model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, {SLiM} 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use.},

We examined the evidence for classic sweeps in resequencing data from 179 human genomes. As expected under a recurrent-sweep model, we found that diversity levels decrease near exons and conserved noncoding regions. In contrast to expectation, however, the trough in diversity around human-specific amino acid substitutions is no more pronounced than around synonymous substitutions. Moreover, relative to the genome background, amino acid and putative regulatory sites are not significantly enriched in alleles that are highly differentiated between populations. These findings indicate that classic sweeps were not a dominant mode of human adaptation over the past {\textbackslash}textasciitilde250,000 years.},

Here, we sequence whole genomes of 13 Capsella grandiflora individuals and quantify the amount of selection across the genome. Using an estimate of the distribution of fitness effects, we show that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, with the exception of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions ({UTRs}). However, estimates of selection on noncoding regions conserved across the Brassicaceae family show strong signals of selection. Additionally, we see reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Finally, using expression data from leaf tissue we show that genes that are more highly expressed experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. Overall, we observe widespread positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but our results also suggest that both positive and negative selection on plant noncoding sequence are considerably rarer than in animal genomes., Selection affects patterns of genomic variation, but it is unclear how much the effects of selection vary across plant genomes, particularly in noncoding regions. To determine the strength and extent of selective signatures across the genome, we sequenced and analyzed genomes from 13 Capsella grandiflora individuals. Because C. grandiflora has experienced a large, stable effective population size, we expect that selection signatures will not be overly distorted by demographic effects. Our analysis shows that positive and negative selection acting on new mutations have broadly shaped patterns of genomic diversity in coding regions but not in most noncoding regions. However, when we focus only on noncoding regions that show evidence of constraint across species, we see evidence for strong positive and negative selection. In addition, we find that genes with high expression experience stronger negative selection than genes with low expression, but the extent of positive selection appears to be equivalent across expression categories.},

Moreover, over the past decade there has been a renewed interest in determining the importance of selection from standing variation in adaptation of natural populations, yet very few methods for inferring this model of adaptation at the genome scale have been introduced. Here we introduce a new method, S/{HIC}, which uses supervised machine learning to precisely infer the location of both hard and soft selective sweeps. We show that S/{HIC} has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover, we show that S/{HIC} is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus, even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/{HIC} still retains impressive discriminatory power. Finally, we apply S/{HIC} to the case of resequencing data from human chromosome 18 in a European population sample, and demonstrate that we can reliably recover selective sweeps that have been identified earlier using less specific and sensitive methods.},

	abstract = {The contribution of regulatory versus protein change to adaptive evolution has long been controversial. In principle, the rate and strength of adaptation within functional genetic elements can be quantified on the basis of an excess of nucleotide substitutions between species compared to the neutral expectation or from effects of recent substitutions on nucleotide diversity at linked sites. Here, we infer the nature of selective forces acting in proteins, their {UTRs} and conserved noncoding elements ({CNEs}) using genome-wide patterns of diversity in wild house mice and divergence to related species. By applying an extension of the {McDonald}-Kreitman test, we infer that adaptive substitutions are widespread in protein-coding genes, {UTRs} and {CNEs}, and we estimate that there are at least four times as many adaptive substitutions in {CNEs} and {UTRs} as in proteins. We observe pronounced reductions in mean diversity around nonsynonymous sites (whether or not they have experienced a recent substitution). This can be explained by selection on multiple, linked {CNEs} and exons. We also observe substantial dips in mean diversity (after controlling for divergence) around protein-coding exons and {CNEs}, which can also be explained by the combined effects of many linked exons and {CNEs}. A model of background selection ({BGS}) can adequately explain the reduction in mean diversity observed around {CNEs}. However, {BGS} fails to explain the wide reductions in mean diversity surrounding exons (encompassing ∼100 Kb, on average), implying that there is a substantial role for adaptation within exons or closely linked sites. The wide dips in diversity around exons, which are hard to explain by {BGS}, suggest that the fitness effects of adaptive amino acid substitutions could be substantially larger than substitutions in {CNEs}. We conclude that although there appear to be many more adaptive noncoding changes, substitutions in proteins may dominate phenotypic evolution., We present an analysis of the genome sequences of multiple wild house mice. Wild house mice are about ten times more genetically diverse than humans, reflecting the large effective population size of the species. This manifests itself as more effective natural selection acting against deleterious mutations and favouring advantageous mutations in mice than in humans. We show that there are strong signals of adaptive evolution at many sites in the genome. We estimate that 80\% of adaptive changes in the genome are in gene regulatory elements and only 20\% are in protein-coding genes. We find that nucleotide diversity is markedly reduced close to gene regulatory elements and protein-coding gene sequences. The reductions around regulatory elements can be explained by selection purging deleterious mutations that occur in the elements themselves, but this process only partially explains the diversity reductions around protein-coding genes. Recurrent adaptive evolution, which can also cause local reductions in diversity via selective sweeps, may be necessary to fully explain the patterns in diversity that we observe surrounding genes. Although most adaptive molecular evolution appears to be regulatory, adaptive phenotypic change may principally be driven by structural change in proteins.},

We analyze this interaction of directional selection and background selection and study their combined effects on neutral variation, using a three-locus model in which each locus is subjected to either deleterious, favorable, or neutral mutations. Average heterozygosity is measured by simulations (1) at the stationary state under the assumption of recurrent hitchhiking events and (2) as a transient level after a single hitchhiking event. The simulation results are compared to theoretical predictions. It is shown that known analytical solutions describing the hitchhiking effect without background selection can be modified such that they accurately predict the joint effects of hitchhiking and background on linked, neutral variation. Generalization of these results to a more appropriate multilocus model (such that background selection can occur at multiple sites) suggests that, in regions of very low recombination rates, stationary levels of nucleotide diversity are primarily determined by hitchhiking, whereas in regions of high recombination, background selection is the dominant force. The implications of these results on the identification and estimation of the relevant parameters of the model are discussed.},

Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ({SNP}) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding {SNPs} found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral ({\textbackslash}textbars{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textless0.01\%), 30-42\% are moderately deleterious (0.01\%{\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textbars{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textless1\%), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal ({\textbackslash}textbars{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}textgreater1\%). Our results are consistent with 10-20\% of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

On the one hand, scans for positive selection have identified hundreds of candidate loci, and the genome-wide patterns of polymorphism show signatures consistent with frequent positive selection. On the other hand, recent studies have argued that many of the candidate loci are false positives and that most genome-wide signatures of adaptation are in fact due to reduction of neutral diversity by linked deleterious mutations, known as background selection. Here we analyze human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project and detect signatures of positive selection once we correct for the effects of background selection. We show that levels of neutral polymorphism are lower near amino acid substitutions, with the strongest reduction observed specifically near functionally consequential amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions are associated with signatures of recent adaptation that should not be generated by background selection, such as unusually long and frequent haplotypes and specific distortions in the site frequency spectrum. We use forward simulations to argue that the observed signatures require a high rate of strongly adaptive substitutions near amino acid changes. We further demonstrate that the observed signatures of positive selection correlate better with the presence of regulatory sequences, as predicted by the {ENCODE} Project Consortium, than with the positions of amino acid substitutions. Our results suggest that adaptation was frequent in human evolution and provide support for the hypothesis of King and Wilson that adaptive divergence is primarily driven by regulatory changes.},

This characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13\% of amino acid substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately 3\%) that appears to have had large selective effects and accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very weak selective effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and illustrate how the rapidly accumulating genome-wide data can be leveraged to address enduring questions about the genetic basis of adaptation.},

To assess the generality of this finding, we have sequenced 257 loci in the outcrossing crucifer Capsella grandiflora, which has a large effective population size and low population structure. Using a new method that jointly infers selective and demographic effects, we estimate that 40\% of amino acid substitutions were fixed by positive selection in this species, and we also infer a low proportion of slightly deleterious amino acid mutations. We contrast these estimates with those for a similar data set from the closely related Arabidopsis thaliana and find significantly higher rates of adaptive evolution and fewer nearly neutral mutations in C. grandiflora. In agreement with results for other taxa, genes involved in reproduction show the strongest evidence for positive selection in C. grandiflora. Taken together, these results imply that both positive and purifying selection are more effective in C. grandiflora than in A. thaliana, consistent with the contrasting demographic history and effective population sizes of these species.},

Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a general framework that efficiently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates sample weights within the genealogical tree at each position on the genome, which are then combined using a summary function; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in three ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated as usual from genome sequence; by branch, which gives the expected value of the dual site statistic under the infinite sites model of mutation, and by node, which summarizes the contribution of each ancestor to these statistics. We use the framework to implement many currently defined statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics’ relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit), as well as the corresponding branch statistics of tree shape. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project data set, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},

Differentiation was high through ∼90\% of the X chromosome. In addition, eight regions of high differentiation were identified on the autosomes, totaling 7.5\% of the autosomal genome. Regions of high differentiation were confirmed by direct sequencing of samples collected from the wild. Some regions of elevated differentiation have an overrepresentation of genes with host–pathogen interactions and olfaction. The most strongly differentiated region on the X has previously been shown to fail to introgress across a hybrid zone between the two subspecies.

Previous studies have shown differences in adaptive evolution across species; however, their specific causes remain elusive. Here, we use improved modeling of weakly deleterious mutations and the demographic history of the outgroup species and ancestral population and estimate that at least 20\% of nonsynonymous substitutions between humans and an outgroup species were fixed by positive selection. This estimate is much higher than previous estimates, which did not correct for the sizes of the outgroup species and ancestral population. Next, we jointly estimate the proportion and selection coefficient (p+ and s+, respectively) of newly arising beneficial nonsynonymous mutations in humans, mice, and Drosophila melanogaster by examining patterns of polymorphism and divergence. We develop a novel composite likelihood framework to test whether these parameters differ across species. Overall, we reject a model with the same p+ and s+ of beneficial mutations across species and estimate that humans have a higher p+s+ compared with that of D. melanogaster and mice. We show that this result cannot be caused by biased gene conversion or hypermutable {CpG} sites. We discuss possible biological explanations that could generate the observed differences in the amount of adaptive evolution across species.},

	abstract = {It has long been suspected that the rate of mutation varies across the human genome at a large scale based on the divergence between humans and other species. However, it is now possible to directly investigate this question using the large number of de novo mutations ({DNMs}) that have been discovered in humans through the sequencing of trios. We investigate a number of questions pertaining to the distribution of mutations using more than 130,000 {DNMs} from three large datasets. We demonstrate that the amount and pattern of variation differs between datasets at the 1MB and 100KB scales probably as a consequence of differences in sequencing technology and processing. In particular, datasets show different patterns of correlation to genomic variables such as replication time. Never-the-less there are many commonalities between datasets, which likely represent true patterns. We show that there is variation in the mutation rate at the 100KB, 1MB and 10MB scale that cannot be explained by variation at smaller scales, however the level of this variation is modest at large scales–at the 1MB scale we infer that {\textbackslash}textasciitilde90\% of regions have a mutation rate within 50\% of the mean. Different types of mutation show similar levels of variation and appear to vary in concert which suggests the pattern of mutation is relatively constant across the genome. We demonstrate that variation in the mutation rate does not generate large-scale variation in {GC}-content, and hence that mutation bias does not maintain the isochore structure of the human genome. We find that genomic features explain less than 40\% of the explainable variance in the rate of {DNM}. As expected the rate of divergence between species is correlated to the rate of {DNM}. However, the correlations are weaker than expected if all the variation in divergence was due to variation in the mutation rate. We provide evidence that this is due the effect of biased gene conversion on the probability that a mutation will become fixed. In contrast to divergence, we find that most of the variation in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between divergence and {DNM} density declines as increasingly divergent species are considered.},

Methylated {CpG} sites provide a natural mutation saturation experiment for fitness effects: as we show, at current sample sizes, not seeing a non-synonymous polymorphism is indicative of strong selection against that mutation. We rely on this idea in order to directly identify a subset of {CpG} transitions that are likely to be highly deleterious, including {\textbackslash}textasciitilde27 \% of possible loss-of-function mutations, and up to 20 \% of possible missense mutations, depending on the type of functional site in which they occur.

We investigated the rate and pattern of mutations at the nucleotide level by comparing pseudogenes in humans and chimpanzees to (i) provide an estimate of the average mutation rate per nucleotide, (ii) assess heterogeneity of mutation rate at different sites and for different types of mutations, (iii) test the hypothesis that the X chromosome has a lower mutation rate than autosomes, and (iv) estimate the deleterious mutation rate. Eighteen processed pseudogenes were sequenced, including 12 on autosomes and 6 on the X chromosome. The average mutation rate was estimated to be {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.5 × 10−8 mutations per nucleotide site or 175 mutations per diploid genome per generation. Rates of mutation for both transitions and transversions at {CpG} dinucleotides are one order of magnitude higher than mutation rates at other sites. Single nucleotide substitutions are 10 times more frequent than length mutations. Comparison of rates of evolution for X-linked and autosomal pseudogenes suggests that the male mutation rate is 4 times the female mutation rate, but provides no evidence for a reduction in mutation rate that is specific to the X chromosome. Using conservative calculations of the proportion of the genome subject to purifying selection, we estimate that the genomic deleterious mutation rate (U) is at least 3. This high rate is difficult to reconcile with multiplicative fitness effects of individual mutations and suggests that synergistic epistasis among harmful mutations may be common.},

	abstract = {Gene conversion involves the unidirectional transfer of genetic material from a 'donor' to an 'acceptor' sequence. It mediates the transfer of genetic information from intact homologous sequences to regions containing double-strand breaks ({DSBs}), and can occur between sister chromatids, homologous chromosomes, and even between homologous sequences on the same chromatid or on different chromosomes.Gene conversion occurs predominantly in meiosis, but also in mitosis.Gene conversion seems to result from either synthesis-dependent strand-annealing ({SDSA}) or double Holliday junction ({HJ}) dissolution, rather than from the random resolution of double {HJs} by an {HJ} resolvase, as predicted by the seminal double-strand break repair ({DSBR}) model.Although the helicases Srs2, {BLM} and Rad54 have been reported to promote {SDSA} individually, the coordinated action of {BLM}, topoisomerase {IIIα} and {BLAP}75 (also known as {RMI}1) is needed to promote double-{HJ} dissolution.The rate of gene conversion depends on multiple factors such as sequence homology and distance between the interacting sequences, but might also be affected by the presence of certain specific sequence motifs.In mammalian cells, gene-conversion tracts are usually short and rarely exceed the order of 1 kb in length.Gene-conversion events constitute an important driving force in genome evolution. Although interlocus gene conversion has been implicated in the concerted evolution of many human gene families, interallelic gene conversion has also been found to occur frequently at certain loci, generating a high level of allelic diversity.The impact of gene conversion on the evolution of multigene families has been mediated by several factors, most notably selection.There is growing evidence from both human population genetic studies and sperm typing to show that gene conversion has had an important role in shaping fine-scale patterns of linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) in the human genome.Given the widespread presence of gene conversion and the short tract length that is usually involved in gene conversion, gene-conversion-generated {SNPs} often constitute 'holes' in the haplotype blocks that serve to reduce the efficacy of {LD}-based association studies.High gene-conversion activity is a common feature of both allelic and non-allelic recombination hotspots; at least 25,000 recombination hotspots have been identified across the human genome.An improved understanding of the role of gene conversion in generating or eliminating recombination hotspots in the human genome promises to improve our ability to predict the locations of unstable genomic regions.Gene conversion has been implicated as the cause of various human genetic diseases.Nearly 50\% of the donor genes involved in interlocus gene-conversion events that cause human inherited disease are functional or partially functional.Nearly all the disease-causing gene-conversion events resulted in the functional loss of the respective acceptor gene, the sole exception being a 'gain-of-function' mutation that occurred in the serine protease gene {PRSS}1.Nearly all known cases of disease-causing interlocus gene conversion occurred between highly homologous sequences located on the same chromosome. There is only one example of the acceptor and donor genes involved residing on different chromosomes: the von Willebrand factor gene ({VWF}) gene (12p13.3) and its pseudogene (22q11.22–q11.23).Our meta-analysis of pathogenic gene-conversion events revealed that, with one exception (88\% between the folate receptor 1 gene ({FOLR}1) and its pseudogene), the homology between the linked donor and the acceptor gene sequences is always {\textbackslash}textgreater92\% and usually {\textbackslash}textgreater95\%.In stark contrast to the frequent detection of pathogenic interlocus gene-conversion events (44 events in 17 genes), the occurrence of interallelic gene-conversion events causing human inherited disease is quite rare, with probably only one bona fide case identified: the {SRY} (sex determining region Y)-box 9 ({SOX}9).Only a few well-documented examples of gene-conversion events in cancer have been reported in the literature.The occurrence of de novo gene-conversion events is indicative of the dynamic nature of this genetic process.Gene conversion can account for the occurrence of some recurrent mutations on different chromosomal backgrounds in different ethnic groups.In the future, gene conversion might provide a possible means to bring about 'natural gene therapy' by offering an important alternative to the introduction of an entire functional gene.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called {phastCons}, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-{HMM}). {PhastCons} works by fitting a phylo-{HMM} to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%–8\% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37\%–53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18\%–37\%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47\%–68\%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements ({HCEs}), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, {HCEs} are associated with the 3′ {UTRs} of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding {HCEs} also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for {RNA} secondary structure.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly evident that natural selection plays a prominent role in shaping patterns of diversity across the genome. The most commonly studied modes of natural selection are positive selection and negative selection, which refer to directional selection for and against derived mutations, respectively. Positive selection can result in hitchhiking events, in which a beneficial allele rapidly replaces all others in the population, creating a valley of diversity around the selected site along with characteristic skews in allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium among linked neutral polymorphisms. Similarly, negative selection reduces variation not only at selected sites but also at linked sites, a phenomenon called background selection ({BGS}). Thus, discriminating between these two forces may be difficult, and one might expect efforts to detect hitchhiking to produce an excess of false positives in regions affected by {BGS}. Here, we examine the similarity between {BGS} and hitchhiking models via simulation. First, we show that {BGS} may somewhat resemble hitchhiking in simplistic scenarios in which a region constrained by negative selection is flanked by large stretches of unconstrained sites, echoing previous results. However, this scenario does not mirror the actual spatial arrangement of selected sites across the genome. By performing forward simulations under more realistic scenarios of {BGS}, modeling the locations of protein-coding and conserved noncoding {DNA} in real genomes, we show that the spatial patterns of variation produced by {BGS} rarely mimic those of hitchhiking events. Indeed, {BGS} is not substantially more likely than neutrality to produce false signatures of hitchhiking. This holds for simulations modeled after both humans and Drosophila, and for several different demographic histories. These results demonstrate that appropriately designed scans for hitchhiking need not consider {BGS}’s impact on false-positive rates. However, we do find evidence that {BGS} increases the false-negative rate for hitchhiking, an observation that demands further investigation.},

However, the extent to which the {DFE} differs across species has yet to be systematically investigated. Furthermore, the biological mechanisms determining the {DFE} in natural populations remain unclear. Here, we show that theoretical models emphasizing different biological factors at determining the {DFE}, such as protein stability, back-mutations, species complexity, and mutational robustness make distinct predictions about how the {DFE} will differ between species. Analyzing amino acid-changing variants from natural populations in a comparative population genomic framework, we find that humans have a higher proportion of strongly deleterious mutations than Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, when comparing the {DFE} across yeast, Drosophila, mice, and humans, the average selection coefficient becomes more deleterious with increasing species complexity. Last, pleiotropic genes have a {DFE} that is less variable than that of nonpleiotropic genes. Comparing four categories of theoretical models, only Fisher’s geometrical model ({FGM}) is consistent with our findings. {FGM} assumes that multiple phenotypes are under stabilizing selection, with the number of phenotypes defining the complexity of the organism. Our results suggest that long-term population size and cost of complexity drive the evolution of the {DFE}, with many implications for evolutionary and medical genomics.},

	abstract = {Regions of the genome that have been the target of positive selection specifically along the human lineage are of special importance in human biology. We used high throughput sequencing combined with methods to enrich human genomic samples for particular targets to obtain the sequence of 22 chromosomal samples at high depth in 40 kb neighborhoods of 49 previously identified 100–400 bp elements that show evidence for human accelerated evolution. In addition to selection, the pattern of nucleotide substitutions in several of these elements suggested an historical bias favoring the conversion of weak (A or T) alleles into strong (G or C) alleles. Here we found strong evidence in the derived allele frequency spectra of many of these 40 kb regions for ongoing weak-to-strong fixation bias. Comparison of the nucleotide composition at polymorphic loci to the composition at sites of fixed substitutions additionally reveals the signature of historical weak-to-strong fixation bias in a subset of these regions. Most of the regions with evidence for historical bias do not also have signatures of ongoing bias, suggesting that the evolutionary forces generating weak-to-strong bias are not constant over time. To investigate the role of selection in shaping these regions, we analyzed the spatial pattern of polymorphism in our samples. We found no significant evidence for selective sweeps, possibly because the signal of such sweeps has decayed beyond the power of our tests to detect them. Together, these results do not rule out functional roles for the observed changes in these regions—indeed there is good evidence that the first two are functional elements in humans—but they suggest that a fixation process (such as biased gene conversion) that is biased at the nucleotide level, but is otherwise selectively neutral, could be an important evolutionary force at play in them, both historically and at present.},

Here, using whole-genome, transcriptome, and methylome data from {\textbackslash}textgreater600 Arabidopsis thaliana individuals, we set out to identify important features influencing selective constraint. Our analyses reveal that multiple factors underlie the accumulation of maladaptive mutations, including gene expression level, gene network connectivity, and gene-body methylation. We then focus on a feature with major effect, nucleotide composition. The ancestral vs. derived status of segregating alleles suggests that {GC}-biased gene conversion, a recombination-associated process that increases the frequency of G and C nucleotides regardless of their fitness effects, shapes sequence patterns in A. thaliana Through estimation of mutational effects, we present evidence that biased gene conversion hinders the purging of deleterious mutations and contributes to a genome-wide signal of decreased efficacy of selection. By comparing these results to two outcrossing relatives, Arabidopsis lyrata and Capsella grandiflora, we find that protein evolution in A. thaliana is as strongly affected by biased gene conversion as in the outcrossing species. Last, we perform simulations to show that natural levels of outcrossing in A. thaliana are sufficient to facilitate biased gene conversion despite increased homozygosity due to selfing. Together, our results show that even predominantly selfing taxa are susceptible to biased gene conversion, suggesting that it may constitute an important constraint to adaptation among plant species.},

These factors could include genomic features (e.g., areas of low recombination) that promote processes like linked selection (positive or purifying selection that affects linked neutral sites) at specific genomic regions. Examinations of repeatable patterns of differentiation across population pairs can provide insight into the role of these factors. Birds are well suited for this work, as genome structure is conserved across this group. Accordingly, we reestimated relative ({FST}) and absolute ({dXY}) differentiation between eight sister pairs of birds that span a broad taxonomic range using a common pipeline. Across pairs, there were modest but significant correlations in window-based estimates of differentiation (up to 3\% of variation explained for {FST} and 26\% for {dXY}), supporting a role for processes at conserved genomic features in generating heterogeneous patterns of differentiation; processes specific to each episode of population divergence likely explain the remaining variation. The role genomic features play was reinforced by linear models identifying several genomic variables (e.g., gene densities) as significant predictors of {FST} and {dXY} repeatability. {FST} repeatability was higher among pairs that were further along the speciation continuum (i.e., more reproductively isolated) providing further insight into how genomic differentiation changes with population divergence; early stages of speciation may be dominated by positive selection that is different between pairs but becomes integrated with processes acting according to shared genomic features as speciation proceeds.},

We address this question in humans by fitting a model of the joint effects of selective sweeps and background selection to autosomal polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project. After controlling for variation in mutation rates along the genome, a model of background selection alone explains {\textasciitilde}60\% of the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale. Adding the effects of selective sweeps driven by adaptive substitutions to the model does not improve the fit, and when both modes of selection are considered jointly, selective sweeps are estimated to have had little or no effect on linked neutral diversity. The regions under purifying selection are best predicted by phylogenetic conservation, with {\textasciitilde}80\% of the deleterious mutations affecting neutral diversity occurring in non-exonic regions. Thus, background selection is the dominant mode of linked selection in humans, with marked effects on diversity levels throughout autosomes.},

In most species, we identify striking megabase-wide regions, where nucleotide diversity is less than 20\% of the chromosomal average. Such regions are found exclusively on the X chromosome. The regions overlap partially among species, suggesting that the underlying targets are partly shared among species. The regions have higher proportions of singleton {SNPs}, higher levels of population differentiation, and a higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratio than the rest of the X chromosome. We show that the extent to which diversity is reduced is incompatible with direct selection or the action of background selection and soft selective sweeps alone, and therefore, we suggest that very strong selective sweeps have independently targeted these specific regions in several species. The only genomic feature that we can identify as strongly associated with loss of diversity is the location of testis-expressed ampliconic genes, which also have reduced diversity around them. We hypothesize that these genes may be responsible for selective sweeps in the form of meiotic drive caused by an intragenomic conflict in male meiosis.},

	abstract = {Great ape clades exhibit variation in the relative mutation rates of different three-base-pair genomic motifs, with closely related species having more similar mutation spectra than distantly related species. This pattern cannot be explained by classical demographic or selective forces, but imply that {DNA} replication fidelity has been perturbed in different ways on each branch of the great ape phylogeny. Here, we use whole-genome variation from 88 great apes to investigate whether these species’ mutation spectra are broadly differentiated across the entire genome, or whether mutation spectrum differences are driven by {DNA} compartments that have particular functional features or chromatin states. We perform principal component analysis ({PCA}) and mutational signature deconvolution on mutation spectra ascertained from compartments defined by features including replication timing and ancient repeat content, finding evidence for consistent species-specific mutational signatures that do not depend on which functional compartments the spectra are ascertained from. At the same time, we find that many compartments have their own characteristic mutational signatures that appear stable across the great ape phylogeny. For example, in a mutation spectrum {PCA} compartmentalized by replication timing, the second principal component explaining 21.2\% of variation separates all species’ late-replicating regions from their early-replicating regions. Our results suggest that great ape mutation spectrum evolution is not driven by epigenetic changes that modify mutation rates in specific genomic regions, but instead by trans-acting mutational modifiers that affect mutagenesis across the whole genome fairly uniformly.},

	abstract = {An explosion of high-throughput {DNA} sequencing in the past decade has led to a surge of interest in population-scale inference with whole-genome data. Recent work in population genetics has centered on designing inference methods for relatively simple model classes, and few scalable general-purpose inference techniques exist for more realistic, complex models. To achieve this, two inferential challenges need to be addressed: (1) population data are exchangeable, calling for methods that efficiently exploit the symmetries of the data, and (2) computing likelihoods is intractable as it requires integrating over a set of correlated, extremely high-dimensional latent variables. These challenges are traditionally tackled by likelihood-free methods that use scientific simulators to generate datasets and reduce them to hand-designed, permutation-invariant summary statistics, often leading to inaccurate inference. In this work, we develop an exchangeable neural network that performs summary statistic-free, likelihood-free inference. Our framework can be applied in a black-box fashion across a variety of simulation-based tasks, both within and outside biology. We demonstrate the power of our approach on the recombination hotspot testing problem, outperforming the state-of-the-art.},

Most strikingly, multiple lines of evidence suggest that gene flow occurred from bonobos into the ancestors of central and eastern chimpanzees between 200 and 550 thousand years ago (Kya), probably with subsequent spread into Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees. Together with another possibly more recent contact (after 200 Kya), bonobos contributed less than 1\% to the central chimpanzee genomes.

	abstract = {Detecting the targets of adaptive natural selection from whole genome sequencing data is a central problem for population genetics. However, to date most methods have shown sub-optimal performance under realistic demographic scenarios. Moreover, over the past decade there has been a renewed interest in determining the importance of selection from standing variation in adaptation of natural populations, yet very few methods for inferring this model of adaptation at the genome scale have been introduced. Here we introduce a new method, S/{HIC}, which uses supervised machine learning to precisely infer the location of both hard and soft selective sweeps. We show that S/{HIC} has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover, we show that S/{HIC} is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus, even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/{HIC} still retains impressive discriminatory power. Finally, we apply S/{HIC} to the case of resequencing data from human chromosome 18 in a European population sample, and demonstrate that we can reliably recover selective sweeps that have been identified earlier using less specific and sensitive methods., The genetic basis of recent adaptation can be uncovered from genomic patterns of variation, which are perturbed in predictable ways when a beneficial mutation “sweeps” through a population. However, the detection of such “selective sweeps” is complicated by demographic events, such as population expansion, which can produce similar skews in genetic diversity. Here, we present a method for detecting selective sweeps that is remarkably powerful and robust to potentially confounding demographic histories. This method, called S/{HIC}, operates using a machine learning paradigm to combine many different features of population genetic variation, and examine their values across a large genomic region in order to infer whether a selective sweep has recently occurred near its center. S/{HIC} is also able to accurately distinguish between selection acting on de novo beneficial mutations (“hard sweeps”) and selection on previously standing variants (“soft sweeps”). We demonstrate S/{HIC}’s power on a variety of simulated datasets as well as human population data wherein we recover several previously discovered targets of recent adaptation as well as a novel selective sweep.},

	abstract = {Understanding the demographic history of populations is a key goal in population genetics, and with improving methods and data, ever more complex models are being proposed and tested. Demographic models of current interest typically consist of a set of discrete populations, their sizes and growth rates, and continuous and pulse migrations between those populations over a number of epochs, which can require dozens of parameters to fully describe. There is currently no standard format to define such models, significantly hampering progress in the field. In particular, the important task of translating the model descriptions in published work into input suitable for population genetic simulators is labor intensive and error prone. We propose the Demes data model and file format, built on widely used technologies, to alleviate these issues. Demes provide a well-defined and unambiguous model of populations and their properties that is straightforward to implement in software, and a text file format that is designed for simplicity and clarity. We provide thoroughly tested implementations of Demes parsers in multiple languages including Python and C, and showcase initial support in several simulators and inference methods. An introduction to the file format and a detailed specification are available at https://popsim-consortium.github.io/demes-spec-docs/., Demographic models of increasing complexity are being inferred and simulated, yet there is no agreed-upon data format for describing these models. Gower, Ragsdale et al. present the Demes specification, a data model and file format definition built on standard technologies which provides a description of complex demographics that is both human-readable and machine-parsable. They provide thoroughly tested software components using this specification and demonstrate Demes support in several popular simulation and inference methods.},

	abstract = {Simulation is a key tool in population genetics for both methods development and empirical research, but producing simulations that recapitulate the main features of genomic data sets remains a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations are possible thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of available genetic data, and to the sophistication of inference and simulation software. However, implementing these simulations still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge. These challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for species that are not well-studied, since it is not always clear what information is required to produce simulations with a level of realism sufficient to confidently answer a given question. The community-developed framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population genetic models using up-to-date information. The initial version of stdpopsim focused on establishing this framework using six well-characterized model species . Here, we report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim (version 0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the species catalog and substantial additions to simulation capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the simulated genomes include non-crossover recombination and provision of species-specific genomic annotations. Through community-driven efforts, we expanded the number of species in the catalog more than three-fold and broadened coverage across the tree of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we have identified common sticking points and developed best practices for setting up genome-scale simulations. We describe the input data required for generating a realistic simulation, suggest good practices for obtaining the relevant information from the literature, and discuss common pitfalls and major considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to further promote the use of realistic whole-genome population genetic simulations, especially in non-model organisms, making them available, transparent, and accessible to everyone.},

Previous studies have shown differences in adaptive evolution across species; however, their specific causes remain elusive. Here, we use improved modeling of weakly deleterious mutations and the demographic history of the outgroup species and ancestral population and estimate that at least 20\% of nonsynonymous substitutions between humans and an outgroup species were fixed by positive selection. This estimate is much higher than previous estimates, which did not correct for the sizes of the outgroup species and ancestral population. Next, we jointly estimate the proportion and selection coefficient (p+ and s+, respectively) of newly arising beneficial nonsynonymous mutations in humans, mice, and Drosophila melanogaster by examining patterns of polymorphism and divergence. We develop a novel composite likelihood framework to test whether these parameters differ across species. Overall, we reject a model with the same p+ and s+ of beneficial mutations across species and estimate that humans have a higher p+s+ compared with that of D. melanogaster and mice. We show that this result cannot be caused by biased gene conversion or hypermutable {CpG} sites.

	abstract = {Quantifying and comparing the amount of adaptive evolution among different species is key to understanding how evolution works. Previous studies have shown differences in adaptive evolution across species; however, their specific causes remain elusive. Here, we use improved modeling of weakly deleterious mutations and the demographic history of the outgroup species and ancestral population and estimate that at least 20\% of nonsynonymous substitutions between humans and an outgroup species were fixed by positive selection. This estimate is much higher than previous estimates, which did not correct for the sizes of the outgroup species and ancestral population. Next, we jointly estimate the proportion and selection coefficient (p+ and s+, respectively) of newly arising beneficial nonsynonymous mutations in humans, mice, and Drosophila melanogaster by examining patterns of polymorphism and divergence. We develop a novel composite likelihood framework to test whether these parameters differ across species. Overall, we reject a model with the same p+ and s+ of beneficial mutations across species and estimate that humans have a higher p+s+ compared with that of D. melanogaster and mice. We show that this result cannot be caused by biased gene conversion or hypermutable {CpG} sites. We discuss possible biological explanations that could generate the observed differences in the amount of adaptive evolution across species.},

	abstract = {In Drosophila and humans, there are accumulating examples of loci with a significant excess of high-frequency-derived alleles or high levels of linkage disequilibrium, relative to a neutral model of a random-mating population of constant size. These are features expected after a recent selective sweep. Their prevalence suggests that positive directional selection may be widespread in both species. However, as I show here, these features do not persist long after the sweep ends: The high-frequency alleles drift to fixation and no longer contribute to polymorphism, while linkage disequilibrium is broken down by recombination. As a result, loci chosen without independent evidence of recent selection are not expected to exhibit either of these features, even if they have been affected by numerous sweeps in their genealogical history. How then can we explain the patterns in the data? One possibility is population structure, with unequal sampling from different subpopulations. Alternatively, positive selection may not operate as is commonly modeled. In particular, the rate of fixation of advantageous mutations may have increased in the recent past.},

	abstract = {Detecting selective sweeps from genomic {SNP} data is complicated by the intricate ascertainment schemes used to discover {SNPs}, and by the confounding influence of the underlying complex demographics and varying mutation and recombination rates. Current methods for detecting selective sweeps have little or no robustness to the demographic assumptions and varying recombination rates, and provide no method for correcting for ascertainment biases. Here, we present several new tests aimed at detecting selective sweeps from genomic {SNP} data. Using extensive simulations, we show that a new parametric test, based on composite likelihood, has a high power to detect selective sweeps and is surprisingly robust to assumptions regarding recombination rates and demography (i.e., has low Type I error). Our new test also provides estimates of the location of the selective sweep(s) and the magnitude of the selection coefficient. To illustrate the method, we apply our approach to data from the Seattle {SNP} project and to Chromosome 2 data from the {HapMap} project. In Chromosome 2, the most extreme signal is found in the lactase gene, which previously has been shown to be undergoing positive selection. Evidence for selective sweeps is also found in many other regions, including genes known to be associated with disease risk such as {DPP}10 and {COL}4A3.},

While genome-wide scans for the footprints of positive Darwinian selection have increased knowledge of genes and functions potentially involved in human local adaptation, they have globally produced evidence of a limited contribution of selective sweeps in humans. Conversely, studies based on machine learning algorithms suggest that recent sweeps from standing variation are widespread in humans, an observation that has been recently questioned. Here, we sought to formally quantify the number of recent selective sweeps in humans, by leveraging approximate Bayesian computation and whole-genome sequence data. Our computer simulations revealed suitable {ABC} estimations, regardless of the frequency of the selected alleles at the onset of selection and the completion of sweeps. Under a model of recent selection from standing variation, we inferred that an average of 68 (from 56 to 79) and 140 (from 94 to 198) sweeps occurred over the last 100,000 years of human history, in African and Eurasian populations, respectively. The former estimation is compatible with human adaptation rates estimated since divergence with chimps, and reveals numbers of sweeps per generation per site in the range of values estimated in Drosophila. Our results confirm the rarity of selective sweeps in humans and show a low contribution of sweeps from standing variation to recent human adaptation.},

As datasets that consist of millions of genomes are now being collected, there is a need for scalable and efficient inference methods to fully utilize these resources.

Analysing the results of simulations also presents a substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact simulation of the coalescent with recombination for chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more quickly than with existing methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly ‘simplify’ a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulation’s entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand for evolutionary models to incorporate relatively realistic dynamics, ranging from selection at many genomic sites to complex demography, population structure, and ecological interactions. Such models can generally be implemented as individual-based forward simulations, but the large computational overhead of these models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in large populations infeasible. This situation presents an important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently developed tree-sequence recording method (Kelleher, Thornton, Ashander, \& Ralph, 2018), which stores the genealogical history of all genomes in the simulated population, could provide such an advance. This method has several benefits: (1) it allows neutral mutations to be omitted entirely from forward-time simulations and added later, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency; (2) it allows neutral burn-in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact, using “recapitation”; (3) it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact representation of a population's genealogy that can be analysed in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the tree-sequence recording method in {SLiM} 3 (a free, open-source evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to allow the recording of non-neutral mutations, greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase several practical applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modelling and exploration of evolutionary processes.},

Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a general framework that efficiently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates sample weights within the genealogical tree at each position on the genome, which are then combined using a summary function; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in three ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated as usual from genome sequence; by branch, which gives the expected value of the dual site statistic under the infinite sites model of mutation, and by node, which summarizes the contribution of each ancestor to these statistics. We use the framework to implement many currently defined statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics’ relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit), as well as the corresponding branch statistics of tree shape. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project data set, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},

Here we introduce a new method, S/{HIC}, which uses supervised machine learning to precisely infer the location of both hard and soft selective sweeps. We show that S/{HIC} has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover, we show that S/{HIC} is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus, even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/{HIC} still retains impressive discriminatory power. Finally, we apply S/{HIC} to the case of resequencing data from human chromosome 18 in a European population sample, and demonstrate that we can reliably recover selective sweeps that have been identified earlier using less specific and sensitive methods.},

	abstract = {Given genomic variation data from multiple individuals, computing the likelihood of complex population genetic models is often infeasible. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a novel likelihood-free inference framework by applying deep learning, a powerful modern technique in machine learning. Deep learning makes use of multilayer neural networks to learn a feature-based function from the input (e.g., hundreds of correlated summary statistics of data) to the output (e.g., population genetic parameters of interest). We demonstrate that deep learning can be effectively employed for population genetic inference and learning informative features of data. As a concrete application, we focus on the challenging problem of jointly inferring natural selection and demography (in the form of a population size change history). Our method is able to separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection, without sequential steps for these two factors. Studying demography and selection jointly is motivated by Drosophila, where pervasive selection confounds demographic analysis. We apply our method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer both their overall demography, and regions of their genome under selection. We find many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, and fewer under selection on standing variation (soft sweep) or balancing selection. Interestingly, we find that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. In addition, our demographic inference suggests that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme.},

	abstract = {Population-scale genomic data sets have given researchers incredible amounts of information from which to infer evolutionary histories. Concomitant with this flood of data, theoretical and methodological advances have sought to extract information from genomic sequences to infer demographic events such as population size changes and gene flow among closely related populations/species, construct recombination maps, and uncover loci underlying recent adaptation. To date, most methods make use of only one or a few summaries of the input sequences and therefore ignore potentially useful information encoded in the data. The most sophisticated of these approaches involve likelihood calculations, which require theoretical advances for each new problem, and often focus on a single aspect of the data (e.g., only allele frequency information) in the interest of mathematical and computational tractability. Directly interrogating the entirety of the input sequence data in a likelihood-free manner would thus offer a fruitful alternative. Here, we accomplish this by representing {DNA} sequence alignments as images and using a class of deep learning methods called convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) to make population genetic inferences from these images. We apply {CNNs} to a number of evolutionary questions and find that they frequently match or exceed the accuracy of current methods. Importantly, we show that {CNNs} perform accurate evolutionary model selection and parameter estimation, even on problems that have not received detailed theoretical treatments. Thus, when applied to population genetic alignments, {CNNs} are capable of outperforming expert-derived statistical methods and offer a new path forward in cases where no likelihood approach exists.},

	abstract = {The reproductive mechanism of a species is a key driver of genome evolution. The standard Wright-Fisher model for the reproduction of individuals in a population assumes that each individual produces a number of offspring negligible compared to the total population size. Yet many species of plants, invertebrates, prokaryotes or fish exhibit neutrally skewed offspring distribution or strong selection events yielding few individuals to produce a number of offspring of up to the same magnitude as the population size. As a result, the genealogy of a sample is characterized by multiple individuals (more than two) coalescing simultaneously to the same common ancestor. The current methods developed to detect such multiple merger events do not account for complex demographic scenarios or recombination, and require large sample sizes. We tackle these limitations by developing two novel and different approaches to infer multiple merger events from sequence data or the ancestral recombination graph ({ARG}): a sequentially Markovian coalescent ({SMβC}) and a graph neural network ({GNNcoal}). We first give proof of the accuracy of our methods to estimate the multiple merger parameter and past demographic history using simulated data under the β-coalescent model. Secondly, we show that our approaches can also recover the effect of positive selective sweeps along the genome. Finally, we are able to distinguish skewed offspring distribution from selection while simultaneously inferring the past variation of population size. Our findings stress the aptitude of neural networks to leverage information from the {ARG} for inference but also the urgent need for more accurate {ARG} inference approaches.},

However, the majority of ancient genomes are of lower coverage and cannot be directly built into genealogies. Here, we present a fast and scalable method, Colate, the first approach for inferring ancestral relationships through time between low-coverage genomes without requiring phasing or imputation. Our approach leverages sharing patterns of mutations dated using a genealogy to infer coalescence rates. For deeply sequenced ancient genomes, we additionally introduce an extension of the Relate algorithm for joint inference of genealogies incorporating such genomes. Application to 278 present-day and 430 ancient {DNA} samples of \&gt;0.5x mean coverage allows us to identify dynamic population structure and directional gene flow between early farmer and European hunter-gatherer groups. We further show that the previously reported, but still unexplained, increase in the {TCC}/{TTC} mutation rate, which is strongest in West Eurasia today, was already present at similar strength and widespread in the Late Glacial Period {\textasciitilde}10k−15k years ago, but is not observed in samples \&gt;30k years old. It is strongest in Neolithic farmers, and highly correlated with recent coalescence rates between other genomes and a 10,000-year-old Anatolian hunter-gatherer. This suggests gene-flow among ancient peoples postdating the last glacial maximum as widespread and localizes the driver of this mutational signal in both time and geography in that region. Our approach should be widely applicable in future for addressing other evolutionary questions, and in other species.},

Through simulations of polygenic trait architecture evolution and {GWASs}, we show the method substantially improves power over current methods. We examine the robustness of the method under stratification, uncertainty and bias in marginal effects, uncertainty in the causal {SNPs}, allelic heterogeneity, negative selection, and low {GWAS} sample size. The method can quantify selection acting on correlated traits, controlling for pleiotropy even among traits with strong genetic correlation ({\textbar}rg{\textbar}=80\%) while retaining high power to attribute selection to the causal trait. When the causal trait is excluded from analysis, selection is attributed to its closest proxy. We discuss limitations of the method, cautioning against strongly causal interpretations of the results, and the possibility of undetectable gene-by-environment ({GxE}) interactions. We apply the method to 56 human polygenic traits, revealing signals of directional selection on pigmentation, life history, glycated hemoglobin ({HbA}1c), and other traits. We also conduct joint testing of 137 pairs of genetically correlated traits, revealing widespread correlated response acting on these traits (2.6-fold enrichment, p = 1.5 × 10−7). Signs of selection on some traits previously reported as adaptive (e.g., educational attainment and hair color) are largely attributable to correlated response (p = 2.9 × 10−6 and 1.7 × 10−4, respectively). Lastly, our joint test shows antagonistic selection has increased type 2 diabetes risk and decrease {HbA}1c (p = 1.5 × 10−5).},

Built on a Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) architecture, a particular type of a Recurrent Neural Network ({RNN}), {SIA} can be trained to explicitly infer a full range of selection coefficients, as well as the allele frequency trajectory and time of selection onset. We benchmarked {SIA} extensively on simulations under a European human demographic model, and found that it performs as well or better as some of the best available methods, including state-of-the-art machine-learning and {ARG}-based methods. In addition, we used {SIA} to estimate selection coefficients at several loci associated with human phenotypes of interest. {SIA} detected novel signals of selection particular to the European ({CEU}) population at the {MC}1R and {ABCC}11 loci. In addition, it recapitulated signals of selection at the {LCT} locus and several pigmentation-related genes. Finally, we reanalyzed polymorphism data of a collection of recently radiated southern capuchino seedeater taxa in the genus Sporophila to quantify the strength of selection and improved the power of our previous methods to detect partial soft sweeps. Overall, {SIA} uses deep learning to leverage the {ARG} and thereby provides new insight into how selective sweeps shape genomic diversity.},

However, existing methods for {ARG} inference are computationally intensive, highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences, and, as a consequence, explicit {ARG} inference is rarely used in applied population genomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm for {ARG} inference that is efficient enough to apply to dozens of complete mammalian genomes. The key idea of our approach is to sample an {ARG} of chromosomes conditional on an {ARG} of chromosomes, an operation we call “threading.” Using techniques based on hidden Markov models, we can perform this threading operation exactly, up to the assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a discretization of time. An extension allows for threading of subtrees instead of individual sequences. Repeated application of these threading operations results in highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for {ARGs}. We have implemented these methods in a computer program called {ARGweaver}. Experiments with simulated data indicate that {ARGweaver} converges rapidly to the posterior distribution over {ARGs} and is effective in recovering various features of the {ARG} for dozens of sequences generated under realistic parameters for human populations. In applications of {ARGweaver} to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics, we find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions of unusually ancient ancestry associated with balancing selection and reductions in allele age in sites under directional selection. The patterns we observe near protein-coding genes are consistent with a primary influence from background selection rather than hitchhiking, although we cannot rule out a contribution from recurrent selective sweeps.},

The structure capturing the details of these intricately interwoven paths of inheritance is referred to as an ancestral recombination graph ({ARG}).

Standard mathematical formalisms, based on exhaustively detailing the "events" that occur in the history of a sample, are insufficient to describe the outputs of current methods. Moreover, we argue that the underlying assumption that all events can be known and precisely estimated is fundamentally unsuited to the realities of modern, population-scale datasets. We propose an alternative mathematical formulation that encompasses the outputs of recent methods and can capture the full richness of modern large-scale datasets. By defining this {ARG} encoding in terms of specific genomes and their intervals of genetic inheritance, we avoid the need to exhaustively list (and estimate) all events. The effects of multiple events can be aggregated in different ways, providing a natural way to express many forms of approximate and partial knowledge about the recombinant ancestry of a sample.},

Using contemporary examples from diverse scientific disciplines, this paper explores differences in practice between historical and experimental research vis-à-vis the testing of hypotheses. It rejects the claim that historical research is epistemically inferior. For as I argue, scientists engage in two very different patterns of evidential reasoning and, although there is overlap, one pattern predominates in historical research and the other pattern predominates in classical experimental research.

	abstract = {The availability of large-scale population genomic sequence data has resulted in an explosion in efforts to infer the demographic histories of natural populations across a broad range of organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies, they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic inference by characterizing the performance of three popular methods through extensive simulation of data sets with varying numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined three different demographic models relevant to a number of species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter estimates of each of these models—often severely. We find that selection can lead to incorrect inferences of population size changes when none have occurred. Moreover, we show that linked selection can lead to incorrect demographic model selection, when multiple demographic scenarios are compared. We argue that natural populations may experience the amount of recent positive selection required to skew inferences. These results suggest that demographic studies conducted in many species to date may have exaggerated the extent and frequency of population size changes.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of purifying selection at multiple sites on both the shape of the genealogy and the distribution of mutations on the tree. We find that the primary effect of purifying selection on a genealogy is to shift the distribution of mutations on the tree, whereas the shape of the tree remains largely unchanged. This result is relevant to the large number of coalescent estimation procedures, which generally assume neutrality for segregating polymorphisms—applying these estimators to evolutionarily constrained sequences could lead to a significant degree of bias. We also estimate the statistical power of several neutrality tests in detecting weak to moderate purifying selection and find that the power is quite good for some parameter combinations. This result contrasts with previous studies, which predicted low statistical power because of the minor effect that weak purifying selection has on the shape of a genealogy. Finally, we investigate the effect of Hill-Robertson interference among linked deleterious mutations on patterns of molecular variation. We find that dependence among selected loci can substantially reduce the efficacy of even fairly strong purifying selection.},

	abstract = {The coalescent process can describe the effects of selection at linked loci only if selection is so strong that genotype frequencies evolve deterministically. Here, we develop methods proposed by Kaplan, Darden, and Hudson to find the effects of weak selection. We show that the overall effect is given by an extension to Price’s equation: the change in properties such as moments of coalescence times is equal to the covariance between those properties and the fitness of the sample of genes. The distribution of coalescence times differs substantially between allelic classes, even in the absence of selection. However, the average coalescence time between randomly chosen genes is insensitive to the current allele frequency and is affected significantly by purifying selection only if deleterious mutations are common and selection is strong (i.e., the product of population size and selection coefficient, Ns \&gt; 3). Balancing selection increases mean coalescence times, but the effect becomes large only when mutation rates between allelic classes are low and when selection is extremely strong. Our analysis supports previous simulations that show that selection has surprisingly little effect on genealogies. Moreover, small fluctuations in allele frequency due to random drift can greatly reduce any such effects. This will make it difficult to detect the action of selection from neutral variation alone.},

Although some methods are available for studying the effects of strong selection (Ns ≫ 1), few tools beyond forward simulation are available for quantifying the impact of weak selection at many sites. Here, we introduce a continuous-state coalescent capable of accurately describing the distortions to genealogies caused by moderate to weak natural selection affecting many linked sites. We calculate approximately the full distribution of pairwise coalescent times, the lengths of coalescent intervals, and the time to the most recent common ancestor of a sample. Weak selection (Ns ≈ 1) is found to substantially decrease the tree depth, primarily through a shortening of the lengths of the basal coalescent intervals. Additionally, we demonstrate that only two parameters, population size and the variance of the distribution describing fitness heritability, are sufficient to describe most changes.},

Its main effect is to reduce overall levels of genetic variation, leading to a reduced effective population size. However, it also distorts genealogies relative to neutral expectations. A structured coalescent method has been used to describe this effect, and forms the basis for numerical methods and simulations. In this study, we extend this approach by making the additional approximation that lineages may be treated independently, which is valid only in the strong selection regime. We show that in this regime, the distortions due to purifying selection can be described by a time-dependent effective population size and mutation rate, confirming earlier intuition. We calculate simple analytical expressions for these functions, Ne(t) and Ue(t). These results allow us to describe the structure of genealogies in a population under strong purifying selection as equivalent to a purely neutral population with varying population size and mutation rate, thereby enabling the use of neutral methods of inference and estimation for populations in the strong selection regime.},

In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 106 or more (and perhaps of 104 or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (− Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron.},

Previous studies of this effect, commonly called selective sweeps, assumed that at most one beneficial allele is on the way to fixation at a given time. However, for a high rate of selected substitutions and a low recombination rate, this assumption can easily be violated. We investigated this problem using full-forward simulations and analytical approximations. We found that interference between linked beneficial alleles causes a reduction of their fixation probabilities. The hitchhiking effect on linked neutral variation for a given substitution also slightly decreases due to interference. As a result, the strength of recurrent selective sweeps is weakened. However, this effect is significant only in chromosomal regions of relatively low recombination rates where the level of variation is greatly reduced. Therefore, previous results on recurrent selective sweeps although derived for a restricted parameter range are still valid. Analytical approximations are obtained for the case of complete linkage for which interference between competing beneficial alleles is maximal.},

	abstract = {Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently available.},

This study investigates the allele frequency distribution under selective sweep models using analytic approximation and simulation. First, given a single selective sweep at a fixed time, I derive an expression for the sampling probabilities of neutral mutants. This solution can be used to estimate the time of the fixation of a beneficial allele from sequence data. Next, I obtain an approximation to mean allele frequencies under recurrent selective sweeps. Under recurrent sweeps, the frequency spectrum is skewed toward rare alleles. However, the excess of high-frequency derived alleles, previously shown to be a signature of single selective sweeps, disappears with recurrent sweeps. It is shown that, using this approximation and multilocus polymorphism data, genomewide parameters of directional selection can be estimated.},

However, the history of genetic relationships in a given population is a fixed, unobserved object, and so an alternative approach is to treat this network of relationships as a complex object we wish to learn about, by observing how genomes have been noisily passed down through it. This paper explores this point of view, showing how to translate questions about population genetic data into calculations with a Poisson process of mutations on all ancestral genomes. This method is applied to give a robust interpretation to the f4 statistic used to identify admixture, and to design a new statistic that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common ancestor between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets population genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions over ancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly interpretable interpretations for these statistics. This provides a method for describing demographic history without simplified demographic models. More generally, it brings into focus the population pedigree, which is averaged over in model-based demographic inference.},

Motivated by this, we use a recently developed method for identifying {IBD} sharing among individuals from genome-wide data to scan populations from the new {HapMap} phase 3 project for regions with excess {IBD} sharing in order to identify regions in the human genome that have been under strong, very recent selection. The {HLA} region is by far the region showing the most extreme signal, suggesting that much of the strong recent selection acting on the human genome has been immune related and acting on {HLA} loci. As equilibrium overdominance does not tend to increase {IBD}, we argue that this type of selection cannot explain our observations.},

	abstract = {Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding {DNA} resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations ({YRI}, {CHB}, {CEU}, and {MXL}) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95\% confidence interval: 40–270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European ({CEU}) and East Asian ({CHB}) divergence time to be 23 kya (95\% c.i.: 17–43 kya), long after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians ({CHB}) and Mexican-Americans ({MXL}) of 22 kya (95\% c.i.: 16.3–26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations ({YRI}, {CHB}, {CEU}).},

The method is applied in the estimation of growth rates of a human population based on 37 {SNP} loci. It is demonstrated how ascertainment biases, due to biased sampling of loci, can be avoided, at least in some cases, by appropriate conditioning when calculating the likelihood function. Second, a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) method for analyzing linked {SNPs} is developed. This method can be used for Bayesian and likelihood inference on linked {SNPs}. The utility of the method is illustrated by estimating recombination rates in a human data set containing 17 {SNPs} and 60 individuals. Both methods are based on assumptions of low mutation rates.},

	abstract = {As a genetic mutation is passed down across generations, it distinguishes those genomes that have inherited it from those that have not, providing a glimpse of the genealogical tree relating the genomes to each other at that site. Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a general framework that efficiently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates sample weights within the genealogical tree at each position on the genome, which are then combined using a summary function; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in three ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated as usual from genome sequence; by branch, which gives the expected value of the dual site statistic under the infinite sites model of mutation, and by node, which summarizes the contribution of each ancestor to these statistics. We use the framework to implement many currently defined statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics' relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit), as well as the corresponding branch statistics of tree shape. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project data set, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},

The appropriate method to use depends on the specific hypothesis or question being asked, and the underlying assumptions of a given method should be carefully considered.As sample sizes become increasingly large, inferences about specific aspects of breeding structure and demography may be possible. However, these methods are still in their infancy and require substantial theoretical and methodological development.The increasing availability of ancient {DNA} from modern and archaic humans provides exciting new possibilities to refine parameters of human evolutionary history, although new methodological development is needed to fully realize the potential of these data.},

The selective effect of the new alleles can be favorable, neutral, or detrimental. The model is applied to the sample configurations of nucleotides in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba. Assuming a synonymous mutation rate of 1.5 x 10(-8) per site per year and 10 generations per year, we obtain estimates for the effective population size (N(e) = 6.5 x 10(6)), the species divergence time (tdiv = 3.74 million years), and an average selection coefficient (sigma = 1.53 x 10(-6) per generation for advantageous or mildly detrimental replacements), although it is conceivable that only two of the amino acid replacements were selected and the rest neutral. The analysis, which includes a sampling theory for the independent infinite sites model with selection, also suggests the estimate that the number of amino acids in the enzyme that are susceptible to favorable mutation is in the range 2-23 at any one time. The approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of a 2 x 2 contingency table to compare fixed differences and polymorphic sites with silent sites and amino acid replacements.},

	abstract = {The availability of large-scale population genomic sequence data has resulted in an explosion in efforts to infer the demographic histories of natural populations across a broad range of organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies, they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic inference by characterizing the performance of three popular methods through extensive simulation of data sets with varying numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined three different demographic models relevant to a number of species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter estimates of each of these models—often severely. We find that selection can lead to incorrect inferences of population size changes when none have occurred. Moreover, we show that linked selection can lead to incorrect demographic model selection, when multiple demographic scenarios are compared. We argue that natural populations may experience the amount of recent positive selection required to skew inferences. These results suggest that demographic studies conducted in many species to date may have exaggerated the extent and frequency of population size changes.},

We here examine how the presence of direct purifying selection and background selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods ({MSMC} and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness effects and the fraction of directly selected sites interact with demographic parameter estimation. The results show that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background selection may cause the mis-inference of population growth under models of both constant population size and decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases, as indicated by the distortion of the site frequency spectrum and levels of nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites. We also show how simulated changes in background selection effects caused by population size changes can be predicted analytically. We propose a potential method for correcting for the mis-inference of population growth caused by selection. By treating the distribution of fitness effect as a nuisance parameter and averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites can be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy.},

	abstract = {A central challenge in the analysis of genetic variation is to provide realistic genome simulation across millions of samples. Present day coalescent simulations do not scale well, or use approximations that fail to capture important long-range linkage properties. Analysing the results of simulations also presents a substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact simulation of the coalescent with recombination for chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more quickly than with existing methods.},

	abstract = {Understanding the demographic history of populations is a key goal in population genetics, and with improving methods and data, ever more complex models are being proposed and tested. Demographic models of current interest typically consist of a set of discrete populations, their sizes and growth rates, and continuous and pulse migrations between those populations over a number of epochs, which can require dozens of parameters to fully describe. There is currently no standard format to define such models, significantly hampering progress in the field. In particular, the important task of translating the model descriptions in published work into input suitable for population genetic simulators is labor intensive and error prone. We propose the Demes data model and file format, built on widely used technologies, to alleviate these issues. Demes provide a well-defined and unambiguous model of populations and their properties that is straightforward to implement in software, and a text file format that is designed for simplicity and clarity. We provide thoroughly tested implementations of Demes parsers in multiple languages including Python and C, and showcase initial support in several simulators and inference methods. An introduction to the file format and a detailed specification are available at https://popsim-consortium.github.io/demes-spec-docs/.},

	abstract = {Simulation is a key tool in population genetics for both methods development and empirical research, but producing simulations that recapitulate the main features of genomic data sets remains a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations are possible thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of available genetic data, and to the sophistication of inference and simulation software. However, implementing these simulations still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge. These challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for species that are not well-studied, since it is not always clear what information is required to produce simulations with a level of realism sufficient to confidently answer a given question. The community-developed framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population genetic models using up-to-date information. The initial version of stdpopsim focused on establishing this framework using six well-characterized model species (). Here, we report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim (version 0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the species catalog and substantial additions to simulation capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the simulated genomes include non-crossover recombination and provision of species-specific genomic annotations. Through community-driven efforts, we expanded the number of species in the catalog more than three-fold and broadened coverage across the tree of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we have identified common sticking points and developed best practices for setting up genome-scale simulations. We describe the input data required for generating a realistic simulation, suggest good practices for obtaining the relevant information from the literature, and discuss common pitfalls and major considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to further promote the use of realistic whole-genome population genetic simulations, especially in non-model organisms, making them available, transparent, and accessible to everyone.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand for evolutionary models to incorporate relatively realistic dynamics, ranging from selection at many genomic sites to complex demography, population structure, and ecological interactions. Such models can generally be implemented as individual-based forward simulations, but the large computational overhead of these models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in large populations infeasible. This situation presents an important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently developed tree-sequence recording method (Kelleher, Thornton, Ashander, \& Ralph, 2018), which stores the genealogical history of all genomes in the simulated population, could provide such an advance. This method has several benefits: (1) it allows neutral mutations to be omitted entirely from forward-time simulations and added later, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency; (2) it allows neutral burn-in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact, using “recapitation”; (3) it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact representation of a population's genealogy that can be analysed in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the tree-sequence recording method in {SLiM} 3 (a free, open-source evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to allow the recording of non-neutral mutations, greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase several practical applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modelling and exploration of evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations of genetic polymorphisms complement analytical approaches for investigating complex evolutionary, epidemiological and ecological scenarios for both applied and theoretical purposes. Current uses include human evolutionary history, understanding the genetic bases of complex diseases, genetic epidemiology, conservation management, plant breeding and infection spread.Dozens of software packages are now available. Some are highly flexible and widely applicable, whereas others address specific tasks, such as case–control studies or continuous populations on dynamic landscapes.Some key features include the ability to: simulate thousands of markers over complex evolutionary histories; create realistic patterns of recombination; model, in detail, a species' life history and mating patterns; integrate selective forces on simple and complex traits; monitor perturbations such as bottlenecks and admixture; and simulate samples from museum specimens and ancient {DNA}.We can divide the uses of simulators into probability-based prediction, making statistical inferences and validating new methods or statistics. Simulations fill various other roles: teaching of genetic concepts, planning of surveys for the collection of genetic samples and post hoc power analysis of data.The steps to follow in implementing a simulation-based study are straightforward, but they do require key user decisions, such as choosing parameters, deciding run length, picking statistics to summarize the data and comparing models to each other or to real data.A crucial step is deciding on an appropriate simulator and, as all simulators have weaknesses, the user must balance selective, demographic, genomic and historical complexity. We provide guidance on these aspects and explain the differences between forward and backward approaches.In general, forward simulators can model life history (such as mating and age structure) and selection (including trait-based or sexual selection) in much more detail, whereas backward simulators are faster and do not require setting initial genetic conditions. A few simulators are currently used most frequently, but the wide range of options and capabilities that are available means that users can and should match a simulator to their study needs.It is important to note that many users will find a simulation package that is 'ready to use' for their analysis, but some simulation projects will require programming skills to integrate the simulator into a bioinformatics pipeline. We also advise that users should carefully plan their simulations, keeping in mind potential limitations or model violations.The future of simulators is certainly bright. Emerging areas of improvement include building increased ecological and landscape realism, connecting genetic simulators to other models, including infection spread or climate change, identifying appropriate and informative summary statistics, recreating biases from next-generation sequence data and increasing efficiency and accessibility.},

	abstract = {Using a new model of isoalleles, extensive Monte Carlo experiments were performed to examine the pattern of allelic distribution in a finite population. In this model it was assumed that the set of allelic states is represented by discrete points on a one-dimensional lattice and that change of state by mutation occurs in such a way that an allele moves either one step in the positive direction or one step in the negative direction on the lattice. Such a model was considered to be appropriate for estimating theoretically the number of electrophoretically detectable alleles within a population. The evenness of allelic distribution was measured by the ratio of the effective to the actual number of alleles (ne/na). The results of the Monte Carlo experiments have shown that this ratio is generally larger under the new model of isoalleles than under the conventional Kimura-Crow model of neutral isoalleles. In other words, the distribution of allelic frequencies within a population is expected to be more uniform in the new model. By comparing the Monte Carlo results with actual observations, it was concluded that the observed deviation from what is predicted under the new model with selective neutrality is not in the direction of conforming to the overdominance hypothesis but is, in fact, in the opposite direction.},

Simulations will provide the key tool to contrast complex hypotheses on real data by generating simulated data under the hypothetical historical and evolutionary conditions that we want to contrast. Undoubtedly, developing tools for simulating large sequences that at the same time allow simulate natural selection, recombination and complex demography patterns will be of great interest in order to better understanding the trace left on the {DNA} by different interacting evolutionary forces. Simulation tools will be also essential to evaluate the sampling properties of any statistics used on genome-wide association studies and to compare performance of methods applied at genome-wide scales. Several recent simulation tools have been developed. Here, we review some of the currently existing simulators which allow for efficient simulation of large sequences on complex evolutionary scenarios. In addition, we will point out future directions in this field which are already a key part of the current research in evolutionary biology and it seems that it will be a primary tool in the future research of genome and postgenomic biology.},

	abstract = {The advent of modern {DNA} sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed. However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing whole-genome data. We present {SweeD} (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used {SweepFinder} program. The sequential version of {SweeD} is up to 22 times faster than {SweepFinder} and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of {SweeD} for multi-core processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to deploy {SweeD} on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well as to resume long-running analyses after processor failures. In addition, the user can specify various demographic models via the command-line to calculate their theoretically expected site frequency spectra. Therefore, (in contrast to {SweepFinder}) the neutral site frequencies can optionally be directly calculated from a given demographic model. We show that an increase of sample size results in more precise detection of positive selection. Thus, the ability to analyze substantially larger sample sizes by using {SweeD} leads to more accurate sweep detection. We validate {SweeD} via simulations and by scanning the first chromosome from the 1000 human Genomes project for selective sweeps. We compare {SweeD} results with results from a linkage-disequilibrium-based approach and identify common outliers.},

	abstract = {Adaptation from standing genetic variation or recurrent de novo mutation in large populations should commonly generate soft rather than hard selective sweeps. In contrast to a hard selective sweep, in which a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency, in a soft selective sweep multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously, producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the adaptive site. Current statistical methods were expressly designed to detect hard sweeps and most lack power to detect soft sweeps. This is particularly unfortunate for the study of adaptation in species such as Drosophila melanogaster, where all three confirmed cases of recent adaptation resulted in soft selective sweeps and where there is evidence that the effective population size relevant for recent and strong adaptation is large enough to generate soft sweeps even when adaptation requires mutation at a specific single site at a locus. Here, we develop a statistical test based on a measure of haplotype homozygosity (H12) that is capable of detecting both hard and soft sweeps with similar power. We use H12 to identify multiple genomic regions that have undergone recent and strong adaptation in a large population sample of fully sequenced Drosophila melanogaster strains from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel ({DGRP}). Visual inspection of the top 50 candidates reveals that in all cases multiple haplotypes are present at high frequencies, consistent with signatures of soft sweeps. We further develop a second haplotype homozygosity statistic (H2/H1) that, in combination with H12, is capable of differentiating hard from soft sweeps. Surprisingly, we find that the H12 and H2/H1 values for all top 50 peaks are much more easily generated by soft rather than hard sweeps. We discuss the implications of these results for the study of adaptation in Drosophila and in species with large census population sizes.},

	abstract = {A selective sweep occurs when positive selection drives an initially rare allele to high population frequency. In nature, the precise parameters of a sweep are seldom known: How strong was positive selection? Did the sweep involve only a single adaptive allele (hard sweep) or were multiple adaptive alleles at the locus sweeping at the same time (soft sweep)? If the sweep was soft, did these alleles originate from recurrent new mutations ({RNM}) or from standing genetic variation ({SGV})? Here, we present a method based on supervised machine learning to infer such parameters from the patterns of genetic variation observed around a given sweep locus. Our method is trained on sweep data simulated with {SLiM}, a fast and flexible framework that allows us to generate training data across a wide spectrum of evolutionary scenarios and can be tailored towards the specific population of interest. Inferences are based on summary statistics describing patterns of nucleotide diversity, haplotype structure, and linkage disequilibrium, which are estimated across systematically varying genomic window sizes to capture sweeps across a wide range of selection strengths. We show that our method can accurately infer selection coefficients in the range 0.01 {\textless} s {\textless} 100 and classify sweep types between hard sweeps, {RNM} soft sweeps, and {SGV} soft sweeps with accuracy 69 \% to 95 \% depending on sweep strength. We also show that the method infers the correct sweep types at three empirical loci known to be associated with the recent evolution of pesticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. Our study demonstrates the power of machine learning for inferring sweep parameters from present-day genotyping samples, opening the door to a better understanding of the modes of adaptive evolution in nature.
Author summary Adaptation often involves the rapid spread of a beneficial genetic variant through the population in a process called a selective sweep. Here, we develop a method based on machine learning that can infer the strength of selection driving such a sweep, and distinguish whether it involved only a single adaptive variant (a so-called hard sweep) or several adaptive variants of independent origin that were simultaneously rising in frequency at the same genomic position (a so-called soft selective sweep). Our machine learning method is trained on simulated data and only requires data sampled from a single population at a single point in time. To address the challenge of simulating realistic datasets for training, we explore the behavior of the method under a variety of testing scenarios, including scenarios where the history of the population of interest was misspecified. Finally, to illustrate the accuracy of our method, we apply it to three known sweep loci that have contributed to the evolution of pesticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster.},

	abstract = {There has been much recent excitement about the use of genetics to elucidate ancestral history and demography. Whole genome data from humans and other species are revealing complex stories of divergence and admixture that were left undiscovered by previous smaller data sets. A central challenge is to estimate the timing of past admixture and divergence events, for example the time at which Neanderthals exchanged genetic material with humans and the time at which modern humans left Africa. Here, we present a method for using sequence data to jointly estimate the timing and magnitude of past admixture events, along with population divergence times and changes in effective population size. We infer demography from a collection of pairwise sequence alignments by summarizing their length distribution of tracts of identity by state ({IBS}) and maximizing an analytic composite likelihood derived from a Markovian coalescent approximation. Recent gene flow between populations leaves behind long tracts of identity by descent ({IBD}), and these tracts give our method power by influencing the distribution of shared {IBS} tracts. In simulated data, we accurately infer the timing and strength of admixture events, population size changes, and divergence times over a variety of ancient and recent time scales. Using the same technique, we analyze deeply sequenced trio parents from the 1000 Genomes project. The data show evidence of extensive gene flow between Africa and Europe after the time of divergence as well as substructure and gene flow among ancestral hominids. In particular, we infer that recent African-European gene flow and ancient ghost admixture into Europe are both necessary to explain the spectrum of {IBS} sharing in the trios, rejecting simpler models that contain less population structure.},

	abstract = {The demographic history of a population drives the pattern of genetic variation and is encoded in the gene-genealogical trees of the sampled alleles. However, existing methods to infer demographic history from genetic data tend to use relatively low-dimensional summaries of the genealogy, such as allele frequency spectra. As a step toward capturing more of the information encoded in the genome-wide sequence of genealogical trees, here we propose a novel framework called the genealogical likelihood ({gLike}), which derives the full likelihood of a genealogical tree under any hypothesized demographic history. Employing a graph-based structure, {gLike} summarizes across independent trees the relationships among all lineages in a tree with all possible trajectories of population memberships through time and efficiently computes the exact marginal probability under a parameterized demographic model. Through extensive simulations and empirical applications on populations that have experienced multiple admixtures, we showed that {gLike} can accurately estimate dozens of demographic parameters when the true genealogy is known, including ancestral population sizes, admixture timing, and admixture proportions. Moreover, when using genealogical trees inferred from genetic data, we showed that {gLike} outperformed conventional demographic inference methods that leverage only the allele-frequency spectrum and yielded parameter estimates that align with established historical knowledge of the past demographic histories for populations like Latino Americans and Native Hawaiians. Furthermore, our framework can trace ancestral histories by analyzing a sample from the admixed population without proxies for its source populations, removing the need to sample ancestral populations that may no longer exist. Taken together, our proposed {gLike} framework harnesses underutilized genealogical information to offer exceptional sensitivity and accuracy in inferring complex demographies for humans and other species, particularly as estimation of genome-wide genealogies improves.},

Let 1 + s, 1 + h, and 1 be, respectively, the relative fitnesses of mutant homozygote A′A′, mutant heterozygote A′A, and wild-type homozygote {AA}. Then, it is shown, on the basis of the diffusion equation method, that the average time until fixation of the mutant allele (A′) in a randomly mating population of effective size Ne, given that the initial frequency is p, is [Formula: see text] in which B(x) = (S/2)x2 + Hx(1 - x), S = 4Nes, H = 4Neh, and V = 4Nev. Of particular interest are the cases in which the mutant allele is deleterious (s = -s′, s′ {\textgreater} 0). Three cases are considered; the mutant is: (i) completely dominant s = h = -s′, (ii) completely recessive s = -s′, h = 0, and (iii) semidominant s = -s′, h = -s′/2, in which s′ is the selection coefficient against the mutant homozygote. It is shown that the average time until fixation is shorter when the deleterious mutant allele is dominant than when it is recessive if 4Nev is larger than 1. On the other hand, the situation is reversed if 4Nev is smaller than 1. It is also shown that for a mutant allele for which Nes′ {\textgreater} 10, it takes such a long time until fixation that we can practically ignore the occurrence of random fixation of a deleterious allele under continued mutation pressure. To supplement the analytical treatment, extensive simulation experiments were performed by using a device called the pseudo-sampling variable, which can enormously accelerate the process of simulation by a computer. This method simulates the diffusion process itself rather than the binominal sampling process (in population genetics the diffusion model is usually regarded as an approximation of the discrete binomial sampling process).},

Gene frequency surfaces generated by a simulation of Wright's isolation-by-distance model were shown to exhibit spatial autocorrelation, except in the panmictic case. Identical stochastic generating processes result in surfaces with characteristics that are functions of the process parameters, such as parental vagility and neighborhood size. Differences in these parameters are detectable as differences in spatial autocorrelations after only a few generations of the simulations. Separate realizations of processes with identical parameters yield similar spatial correlograms. We have examined the inferences about population structure that could have been made from these observations if they had been real, rather than simulated, populations.

In particular, signals of past demographic size changes are often inferred from genetic data by assuming that the analysed sample is drawn from a population without any internal subdivision. However, it has been shown that a bottleneck signal can result from the presence of some recent immigrants in a population. It thus appears important to contrast these two alternative scenarios in a model choice procedure to prevent wrong conclusions to be made. We use here an Approximate Bayesian Computation ({ABC}) approach to infer whether observed patterns of genetic diversity in a given sample are more compatible with it being drawn from a panmictic population having gone through some size change, or from one or several demes belonging to a recent finite island model. Simulations show that we can correctly identify samples drawn from a subdivided population in up to 95\% of the cases for a wide range of parameters. We apply our model choice procedure to the case of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and find conclusive evidence that Western and Eastern chimpanzee samples are drawn from a spatially subdivided population.},

	abstract = {Given genomic variation data from multiple individuals, computing the likelihood of complex population genetic models is often infeasible. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a novel likelihood-free inference framework by applying deep learning, a powerful modern technique in machine learning. Deep learning makes use of multilayer neural networks to learn a feature-based function from the input (e.g., hundreds of correlated summary statistics of data) to the output (e.g., population genetic parameters of interest). We demonstrate that deep learning can be effectively employed for population genetic inference and learning informative features of data. As a concrete application, we focus on the challenging problem of jointly inferring natural selection and demography (in the form of a population size change history). Our method is able to separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection, without sequential steps for these two factors. Studying demography and selection jointly is motivated by Drosophila, where pervasive selection confounds demographic analysis. We apply our method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer both their overall demography, and regions of their genome under selection. We find many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, and fewer under selection on standing variation (soft sweep) or balancing selection. Interestingly, we find that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. In addition, our demographic inference suggests that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme.},

	abstract = {The consequences of selection at linked sites are multiple and widespread across the genomes of most species. Here, I first review the main concepts behind models of selection and linkage in recombining genomes, present the difficulty in parametrizing these models simply as a reduction in effective population size (Ne) and discuss the predicted impact of recombination rates on levels of diversity across genomes. Arguments are then put forward in favour of using a model of selection and linkage with neutral and deleterious mutations (i.e. the background selection model, {BGS}) as a sensible null hypothesis for investigating the presence of other forms of selection, such as balancing or positive. I also describe and compare two studies that have generated high-resolution landscapes of the predicted consequences of selection at linked sites in Drosophila melanogaster Both studies show that {BGS} can explain a very large fraction of the observed variation in diversity across the whole genome, thus supporting its use as null model. Finally, I identify and discuss a number of caveats and challenges in studies of genetic hitchhiking that have been often overlooked, with several of them sharing a potential bias towards overestimating the evidence supporting recent selective sweeps to the detriment of a {BGS} explanation. One potential source of bias is the analysis of non-equilibrium populations: it is precisely because models of selection and linkage predict variation in Ne across chromosomes that demographic dynamics are not expected to be equivalent chromosome- or genome-wide. Other challenges include the use of incomplete genome annotations, the assumption of temporally stable recombination landscapes, the presence of genes under balancing selection and the consequences of ignoring non-crossover (gene conversion) recombination events.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation in sexual organisms'.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary forces shape patterns of genetic diversity within populations and contribute to phenotypic variation. In particular, recurrent positive selection has attracted significant interest in both theoretical and empirical studies. However, most existing theoretical models of recurrent positive selection cannot easily incorporate realistic confounding effects such as interference between selected sites, arbitrary selection schemes, and complicated demographic processes. It is possible to quantify the effects of arbitrarily complex evolutionary models by performing forward population genetic simulations, but forward simulations can be computationally prohibitive for large population sizes (\&gt;105). A common approach for overcoming these computational limitations is rescaling of the most computationally expensive parameters, especially population size. Here, we show that ad hoc approaches to parameter rescaling under the recurrent hitchhiking model do not always provide sufficiently accurate dynamics, potentially skewing patterns of diversity in simulated {DNA} sequences. We derive an extension of the recurrent hitchhiking model that is appropriate for strong selection in small population sizes and use it to develop a method for parameter rescaling that provides the best possible computational performance for a given error tolerance. We perform a detailed theoretical analysis of the robustness of rescaling across the parameter space. Finally, we apply our rescaling algorithms to parameters that were previously inferred for Drosophila and discuss practical considerations such as interference between selected sites.},

We show that 10-30\% of pairs of individuals within a population  share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent  ancestry and that up to 1\% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily  because they lie within recombination hotspots.

Using extreme value theory, I derive this distribution and show that it has two unexpected properties. First, the distribution of beneficial fitness effects at a gene is exponential. Second, the distribution of beneficial effects at a gene has the same mean regardless of the fitness of the present wild-type allele. Adaptation from new mutations is thus characterized by a kind of invariance: natural selection chooses from the same spectrum of beneficial effects at a locus independent of the fitness rank of the present wild type. I show that these findings are reasonably robust to deviations from several assumptions. I further show that one can back calculate the mean size of new beneficial mutations from the observed mean size of fixed beneficial mutations.},

The problem is challenging because modelling the interactions between evolutionary processes is difficult, and different processes can impact genetic variation in similar ways. In this paper, we describe how diversity and divergence between closely related species change with time, using correlations between landscapes of genetic variation as a tool to understand the interplay between evolutionary processes. We find strong correlations between landscapes of diversity and divergence in a well sampled set of great ape genomes, and explore how various processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, mutation rate variation, {GC}-biased gene conversion and selection contribute to these correlations. Through highly realistic, chromosome-scale, forward-in-time simulations we show that the landscapes of diversity and divergence in the great apes are too well correlated to be explained via strictly neutral processes alone. Our best fitting simulation includes both deleterious and beneficial mutations in functional portions of the genome, in which \$9{\textbackslash}\%\$ of fixations within those regions is driven by positive selection. This study provides a framework for modelling genetic variation in closely related species, an approach which can shed light on the complex balance of forces that have shaped genetic variation.},

	abstract = {The complex correlation structure of a collection of orthologous {DNA} sequences is uniquely captured by the “ancestral recombination graph” ({ARG}), a complete record of coalescence and recombination events in the history of the sample. However, existing methods for {ARG} inference are computationally intensive, highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences, and, as a consequence, explicit {ARG} inference is rarely used in applied population genomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm for {ARG} inference that is efficient enough to apply to dozens of complete mammalian genomes. The key idea of our approach is to sample an {ARG} of chromosomes conditional on an {ARG} of chromosomes, an operation we call “threading.” Using techniques based on hidden Markov models, we can perform this threading operation exactly, up to the assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a discretization of time. An extension allows for threading of subtrees instead of individual sequences. Repeated application of these threading operations results in highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for {ARGs}. We have implemented these methods in a computer program called {ARGweaver}. Experiments with simulated data indicate that {ARGweaver} converges rapidly to the posterior distribution over {ARGs} and is effective in recovering various features of the {ARG} for dozens of sequences generated under realistic parameters for human populations. In applications of {ARGweaver} to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics, we find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions of unusually ancient ancestry associated with balancing selection and reductions in allele age in sites under directional selection. The patterns we observe near protein-coding genes are consistent with a primary influence from background selection rather than hitchhiking, although we cannot rule out a contribution from recurrent selective sweeps.},

We use these methods to build genome-wide genealogies using genotyping data for 337,464 {UK} Biobank individuals and test for association across seven complex traits. Genealogy-based association detects more rare and ultra-rare signals (N = 134, frequency range 0.0007−0.1\%) than genotype imputation using {\textasciitilde}65,000 sequenced haplotypes (N = 64). In a subset of 138,039 exome sequencing samples, these associations strongly tag (average r = 0.72) underlying sequencing variants enriched (4.8×) for loss-of-function variation.

Despite the plethora of different models for deep learning on graphs, few approaches have been proposed thus far for dealing with graphs that present some sort of dynamic nature (e.g. evolving features or connectivity over time). In this paper, we present Temporal Graph Networks ({TGNs}), a generic, efficient framework for deep learning on dynamic graphs represented as sequences of timed events. Thanks to a novel combination of memory modules and graph-based operators, {TGNs} are able to significantly outperform previous approaches being at the same time more computationally efficient. We furthermore show that several previous models for learning on dynamic graphs can be cast as specific instances of our framework. We perform a detailed ablation study of different components of our framework and devise the best configuration that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several transductive and inductive prediction tasks for dynamic graphs.},

Across several simulated scenarios, {CoalNN} matched or outperformed the accuracy of model-based approaches for pairwise {TMRCA} and allele age prediction. We applied {CoalNN} to settings for which model-based approaches are under-developed and performed analyses to gain insights into the set of features it uses to perform {TMRCA} prediction. We next used {CoalNN} to analyze 2,504 samples from 26 populations in the 1,000 Genome Project data set, inferring the age of ∼80 million variants. We observed substantial variation across populations and for variants predicted to be pathogenic, reflecting heterogeneous demographic histories and the action of negative selection. We used {CoalNN}’s predicted allele ages to construct genome-wide annotations capturing the signature of past negative selection. We performed {LD}-score regression analysis of heritability using summary association statistics from 63 independent complex traits and diseases (average N=314k), observing increased annotation-specific effects on heritability compared to a previous allele age annotation.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern {AI}. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for {AI} to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the {AI} toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

	abstract = {The ancestral recombination graph is a structure that describes the joint genealogies of sampled {DNA} sequences along the genome. Recent computational methods have made impressive progress toward scalably estimating whole-genome genealogies. In addition to inferring the ancestral recombination graph, some of these methods can also provide ancestral recombination graphs sampled from a defined posterior distribution. Obtaining good samples of ancestral recombination graphs is crucial for quantifying statistical uncertainty and for estimating population genetic parameters such as effective population size, mutation rate, and allele age. Here, we use standard neutral coalescent simulations to benchmark the estimates of pairwise coalescence times from 3 popular ancestral recombination graph inference programs: {ARGweaver}, Relate, and tsinfer+tsdate. We compare (1) the true coalescence times to the inferred times at each locus; (2) the distribution of coalescence times across all loci to the expected exponential distribution; (3) whether the sampled coalescence times have the properties expected of a valid posterior distribution. We find that inferred coalescence times at each locus are most accurate in {ARGweaver}, and often more accurate in Relate than in tsinfer+tsdate. However, all 3 methods tend to overestimate small coalescence times and underestimate large ones. Lastly, the posterior distribution of {ARGweaver} is closer to the expected posterior distribution than Relate's, but this higher accuracy comes at a substantial trade-off in scalability. The best choice of method will depend on the number and length of input sequences and on the goal of downstream analyses, and we provide guidelines for the best practices.},

	abstract = {Investigators have recently introduced powerful methods for population genetic inference that rely on supervised machine learning from simulated data. Despite their performance advantages, these methods can fail when the simulated training data does not adequately resemble data from the real world. Here, we show that this “simulation mis-specification” problem can be framed as a “domain adaptation” problem, where a model learned from one data distribution is applied to a dataset drawn from a different distribution. By applying an established domain-adaptation technique based on a gradient reversal layer ({GRL}), originally introduced for image classification, we show that the effects of simulation mis-specification can be substantially mitigated. We focus our analysis on two state-of-the-art deep-learning population genetic methods—{SIA}, which infers positive selection from features of the ancestral recombination graph ({ARG}), and {ReLERNN}, which infers recombination rates from genotype matrices. In the case of {SIA}, the domain adaptive framework also compensates for {ARG} inference error. Using the domain-adaptive {SIA} ({dadaSIA}) model, we estimate improved selection coefficients at selected loci in the 1000 Genomes {CEU} population. We anticipate that domain adaptation will prove to be widely applicable in the growing use of supervised machine learning in population genetics.},

	abstract = {Some general likelihood and Bayesian methods for analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) are presented. First, an efficient method for estimating demographic parameters from {SNPs} in linkage equilibrium is derived. The method is applied in the estimation of growth rates of a human population based on 37 {SNP} loci. It is demonstrated how ascertainment biases, due to biased sampling of loci, can be avoided, at least in some cases, by appropriate conditioning when calculating the likelihood function. Second, a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) method for analyzing linked {SNPs} is developed. This method can be used for Bayesian and likelihood inference on linked {SNPs}. The utility of the method is illustrated by estimating recombination rates in a human data set containing 17 {SNPs} and 60 individuals. Both methods are based on assumptions of low mutation rates.},

	abstract = {The sampling distribution of a collection of {DNA} sequences is studied under a model where recombination can occur in the ancestry of the sequences. The infinitely-many-sites model of mutation is assumed where there may only be one mutation at a given site. Ancestral inference procedures are discussed for: estimating recombination and mutation rates; estimating the times to the most recent common ancestors along the sequences; estimating ages of mutations; and estimating the number of recombination events in the ancestry of the sample. Inferences are made conditional on the configuration of the pattern of mutations at sites in observed sample sequences. A computational algorithm based on a Markov chain simulation is developed, implemented, and illustrated with examples for these inference procedures. This algorithm is very computationally intensive.

The technique is Metropolis-Hastings sampling: we explore a large number of possible reconstructions of the recombinant genealogy, weighting according to their posterior probability with regard to the data and working values of the parameters. Different relative rates of recombination at different locations can be accommodated if they are known from external evidence, but the algorithm cannot itself estimate rate differences. The estimates of Θ are accurate and apparently unbiased for a wide range of parameter values. However, when both Θ and r are relatively low, very long sequences are needed to estimate r accurately, and the estimates tend to be biased upward. We apply this method to data from the human lipoprotein lipase locus.},

New developments have made it possible to infer {ARGs} at scale, enabling many new applications in population and statistical genetics.

Standard mathematical formalisms, based on exhaustively detailing the “events” that occur in the history of a sample, are insufficient to describe the outputs of current methods.

By defining this {ARG} encoding in terms of specific genomes and their intervals of genetic inheritance, we avoid the need to exhaustively list (and estimate) all events. The effects of multiple events can be aggregated in different ways, providing a natural way to express many forms of approximate and partial knowledge about the recombinant ancestry of a sample.

The number of ancestors, backward in time, of a sample of genes can thus decrease or increase and is found to be a birth and death process. Instead of a one-locus ancestral tree the ancestral paths of a sample of gene pairs are described by a graph with leaves as the sample genes and an eventual common ancestor where all paths from the leaves lead. In this paper properties of the two-locus ancestral graph and the two marginal ancestral trees are studied.},

	abstract = {The coalescent with recombination describes the distribution of genealogical histories and resulting patterns of genetic variation in samples of {DNA} sequences from natural populations. However, using the model as the basis for inference is currently severely restricted by the computational challenge of estimating the likelihood. We discuss why the coalescent with recombination is so challenging to work with and explore whether simpler models, under which inference is more tractable, may prove useful for genealogy-based inference. We introduce a simplification of the coalescent process in which coalescence between lineages with no overlapping ancestral material is banned. The resulting process has a simple Markovian structure when generating genealogies sequentially along a sequence, yet has very similar properties to the full model, both in terms of describing patterns of genetic variation and as the basis for statistical inference.},
